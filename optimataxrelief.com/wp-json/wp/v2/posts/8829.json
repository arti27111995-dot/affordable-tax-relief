Enrolled agents can assist with the following:<ul><li>The preparation of both individual and business tax returns.<\/li><li>The representation of clients.<\/li><li>Other aspects of being a tax professional.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>A tax attorney is licensed by the state to practice law.

Based on what service you need, choosing the right tax professional or tax preparer can help you get back on track with your taxes, small business, and much more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Enrolled Agents<\/strong> are IRS-authorized tax professionals who work alongside the U.S. Department of the Treasury by providing representation to individuals who need tax assistance.<\/li><li><strong>Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) <\/strong>have state certifications to practice accounting.

CPAs can provide a wider scope of tax services for individuals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working with an EA would be beneficial for those who have IRS issues such as individuals who are in collections or dealing with an audit with the IRS. An EA would be best suited for someone who needs assistance with the IRS to help them with their tax concerns.

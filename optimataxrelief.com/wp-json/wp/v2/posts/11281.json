While the relief might be immense, it&#8217;s essential to understand that canceled debt can have significant tax implications. Many individuals are unaware that in certain circumstances, forgiven debts can be considered taxable income by the IRS. So, are canceled liabilities taxable? In this article, we will review the concept of canceled debt and its potential tax implications.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Understanding Canceled Debt<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Canceled <\/span>or forgiven <span data-contrast=\"auto\">debt occurs when a creditor releases a borrower from the obligation to repay a portion or the entirety of a debt. This situation typically arises when borrowers face financial hardships, negotiate debt settlements, or undergo bankruptcy proceedings. The canceled debt can encompass various types, including credit card debt, mortgages, personal loans, or business debts. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Tax Consequences<\/span><\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The IRS generally considers canceled debt as taxable income, which can come as a surprise to many borrowers. From the IRS&#8217;s perspective, forgiven debt is l<\/span>ike<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> receiving cash or other income, thus making it subject to taxation. S<\/span>o,<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> although you d<\/span>on&#8217;t<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> have to repay the debt, you might have to pay taxes on the amount forgiven.<\/span> If necessary, it is typically paid<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> in the year it was canceled.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Exceptions<\/span><\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Fortunately, the IRS provides certain exceptions that can exclude canceled debt from being taxable income in specific situations. Some of these include:<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Bankruptcy<\/span><\/b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. Canceled debt discharged through a bankruptcy proceeding is generally not taxable. This exclusion applies to both <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/chapter-7-bankruptcy-and-taxes\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Chapter 7<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/chapter-13-bankruptcy-and-taxes\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Chapter 13<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> bankruptcies.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Insolvency<\/span><\/b>.<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> If you were insolvent immediately before the debt cancellation, the canceled debt may not be taxable. T<\/span>his basically means your liabilities exceed your assets. <span data-contrast=\"auto\">You must file IRS Form 982 to claim this exclusion.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Qualified Principal Residence Indebtedness<\/span><\/b>.<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 allows taxpayers to exclude up to $2 million ($1 million for other filing statues) of forgiven mortgage debt on their primary residence for years 2007 through 2020. This act also applies to discharged debt in 2021 i<\/span>f<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> there was a written agreement in place in 2020. In addition, The Consolidated Appropriations Act (CAA)\u00a0of 2020 excludes qualified canceled mortgage debt, up to $750,000 for married couples and $350,000 for other filers, from taxable income for tax years 2021 through 2025.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Some Student Loan Forgiveness<\/span><\/b>.<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Some student loans are canceled after working in a certain profession for a specified number of years. Some student loan forgiveness in the years 2021 through 2025 are not considered taxable income. \u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Tax Reporting and Documentation<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For canceled debt that qualifies as taxable income, the creditor m<\/span>ust<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> report the forgiven amount on <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/1099s-explained-faqs\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Form 1099-C<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, Cancellation of Debt. Form 1099-C reports all eligible canceled debt of $600 or more per occurrence. Taxpayers should note that if they had debt under $600 that was canceled, it still needs to be reported as income, even if they don\u2019t receive a 1099-C.\u00a0The debtor should receive this form from the creditor.<\/span> They m<span data-contrast=\"auto\">ust include the forgiven debt i<\/span>n<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> their annual income when<\/span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">i<\/span>f<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> it\u2019s not an excluded debt. However, if your debt does fall under one of the IRS\u2019s exclusions, you should still file your return with Form 1099-C to acknowledge it. In addition, if you receive Form 1099-C after filing your tax return, you should file an amended return and include the Form 1099-C. Not doing so may raise some red flags with the IRS that can result in a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/ask-phil-audits\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">tax audit<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. Finally, if there is an error on your Form 1099-C, you should contact the creditor immediately to request a corrected version. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tax Help for Those with Canceled Liabilities<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Remember, you should always consult the help of a knowledgeable tax professional if you are unsure about your tax situation.\u00a0<\/span>Affordable Tax Relief is the nation\u2019s leading tax resolution firm with over a decade of experience helping taxpayers with tough tax situations.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If You Need Tax Help, Contact Us Today for a <\/span><\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/app.optimataxrelief.com\/tax-problems\/?t=99&amp;utm_source=otr-blog-post&amp;utm_campaign=blog-cta&amp;adgroup=free-consultation&amp;network=otr-blogl&amp;ad=07-25-2023\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Free Consultation<\/span><\/b><\/a><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dealing with debt can be a stressful and overwhelming experience.

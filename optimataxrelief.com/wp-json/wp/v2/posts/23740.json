While employees may appreciate the boost to their paychecks, questions often arise about how overtime earnings are taxed, especially after the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill in July 2025.&nbsp;Understanding the tax treatment of overtime pay is essential for managing your finances and avoiding unexpected tax bills.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-overtime-pay-nbsp\"><strong>What is Overtime Pay?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Overtime pay refers to the additional compensation employees receive when they work more than the standard number of hours defined by their employer or labor laws. In the United States, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) generally mandates that non-exempt employees be paid at least 1.5 times their regular rate for hours worked beyond 40 in a workweek.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s look at an example. If an employee earns $20 per hour and works 45 hours in a week, they\u2019ll receive $20 per hour for the first 40 hours and $30 per hour for the additional 5 hours. This results in $150 in overtime pay. Overtime is particularly common in industries like healthcare, retail, manufacturing, and transportation, where demand for services often requires employees to work extended hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-is-overtime-pay-taxed-after-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-nbsp-nbsp\"><strong>How is Overtime Pay Taxed After the One Big Beautiful Bill?&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From a payroll perspective, overtime pay is taxed like regular income. It is subject to the same federal income tax, state and local taxes (where applicable), and payroll taxes (Social Security and Medicare). However, under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), signed into law on July 4, 2025, introduces a major change to how overtime pay is treated at tax time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>The \u201cNo Tax on Overtime\u201d Rule<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Overtime pay is still taxed under the OBBBA and your paychecks will not be any bigger. However, the bill does allow eligible employees to deduct up to $12,500 of their overtime earnings from their federal taxable income each year. Married couples filing jointly can deduct up to $25,000. The deduction applies to FLSA-qualified overtime earned by nonexempt employees and is retroactive to January 1, 2025, continuing through 2028.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s crucial that taxpayers understand that this deduction only covers the \u201chalf\u2011time premium\u201d portion of your pay. In other words, you can only deduct the \u201chalf\u201d in \u201ctime-and-a-half.\u201d&nbsp;Let\u2019s say your regular hourly wage is $20. When you work overtime, you&#8217;re paid time-and-a-half, so $30 per hour. The deduction only applies to the extra $10 you earn per overtime hour (the \u201chalf-time premium\u201d), not the full $30. So, if you worked 100 overtime hours in a year, you could deduct $1,000 (100 hours \u00d7 $10), not the full $3,000 in overtime pay. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The deduction begins to phase out at an modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) of $150,000 for single filers and $300,000 for joint filers. Individuals must also have a valid Social Security number to qualify. Importantly, the deduction only applies to federal income tax and does not affect payroll taxes or state\/local taxes unless a state adopts a similar provision.\u00a0Some other important things to note:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Overtime earnings remain subject to state income taxes (if applicable), Social Security, and Medicare taxes.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The deduction is not available for those using the Married Filing Separately status.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can take this deduction even if you don\u2019t itemize.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>This deduction is temporary and will be in effect from 2025 through 2028.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-does-this-mean-overtime-isn-t-taxed-at-all-nbsp\"><strong>Does This Mean Overtime Isn\u2019t Taxed at All?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No. Here\u2019s how taxes still apply. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Federal Income Tax<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, all overtime pay was fully taxable as regular income. Now, under the OBBBA, qualified employees can reduce their taxable income by claiming the overtime deduction. For example, if an employee earns $60,000 in base wages and $10,000 in overtime, they may deduct up to $10,000 (if under the $12,500 cap) and pay federal income tax on just $60,000.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>State Income Tax<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>States have their own tax rules, and the federal deduction does not automatically apply at the state level. For example, a worker in California earning $90,000 in base pay and $10,000 in overtime can deduct up to $10,000 for federal taxes, but their full $100,000 remains subject to California\u2019s progressive income tax. Meanwhile, workers in states like Texas or Florida won\u2019t owe <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/moving-to-a-no-income-tax-state\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">state income tax<\/a> regardless.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Overtime Still Withheld from My Paycheck?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with the federal deduction in place, employers must still withhold taxes on overtime wages as if they are fully taxable. This includes:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Federal income tax&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Social Security (6.2% on wages up to $176,100 in 2025)&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Medicare (1.45% on all wages, plus an extra 0.9% for high earners)&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>State and local income taxes, where applicable&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The deduction is claimed at tax time, meaning it does not reduce your tax withholding throughout the year. As a result, some employees may choose to update their W-4 forms to better reflect their lower expected taxable income.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-other-taxes-applied-to-overtime-pay-nbsp-nbsp\"><strong>Other Taxes Applied to Overtime Pay&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to federal and state income taxes, overtime pay is&nbsp;also subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes, collectively known as&nbsp;FICA taxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Social Security Tax&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Social Security tax rate is 6.2% on earnings up to a wage base limit, which is $176,100 in 2025. Overtime pay contributes to your total wages. If your annual income exceeds the wage base limit, earnings above this threshold are not subject to Social Security tax. For example, if your base wages are $150,000 and you earn $30,000 in overtime, only $26,100 of the overtime would be taxed for Social Security.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>$176,100 &#8211; $150,000 = $26,100<\/em>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Medicare Tax&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Medicare tax rate is 1.45% on all earnings with no wage cap. An additional 0.9% Medicare tax applies to income above $200,000 for single filers or $250,000 for joint filers. The overtime deduction does not apply to these payroll taxes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Does Overtime Pay Affect Tax Refunds or Owed Taxes?&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, potentially. Since employers withhold taxes on the full amount of overtime wages, eligible employees may see a larger tax refund when they deduct overtime income on their federal return. However, if withholding was underestimated or you don&#8217;t qualify for the full deduction due to high income, you could still owe additional taxes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Strategies to<\/strong><strong> Maximize the New Overtime Tax Break <\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This deduction provides a unique opportunity to rethink your tax strategy: &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Adjust Your W-4&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Update your W-4 form to account for lower taxable income.

Opponents warn it may:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Discourage base wage increases in favor of tax-free overtime.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Encourage employers to overuse overtime instead of hiring additional staff.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Open loopholes for high earners to reclassify income as \u201covertime\u201d to avoid taxes.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether this deduction will remain after 2028 is unclear.

This deduction lowers the amount of income subject to federal income tax but does not affect payroll or state taxes. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Q: Can I reclassify regular wages as overtime to avoid tax?<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A: No. Attempts to game the system may result in audits or penalties. Employers are responsible for correctly categorizing pay.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Q: Is overtime taxed more for Social Security and Medicare?&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A: No. Overtime earnings are subject to the same FICA rates, which is 6.2% for&nbsp;Social Security&nbsp;(up to the wage base) and 1.45% for Medicare (with an additional 0.9% on high earners), as regular wages.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Q: Is overtime taxed at the state level?&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A: Overtime is taxed under your state\u2019s regular income-tax rules. If your state has progressive brackets, the additional income may be taxed at a higher bracket, but there\u2019s no special \u201covertime rate.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Q: Is overtime taxed more when I\u2019m a contractor or freelancer?&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A: As a contractor, you don\u2019t get FLSA overtime but do pay self-employment tax (15.3% total FICA) on all earnings. There\u2019s no extra income-tax surcharge specifically for overtime.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tax-help-in-2025-nbsp\"><strong>Tax Help in 2025<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the One Big Beautiful Bill, overtime wages are still taxed at the time of payment, but eligible employees can now deduct up to $12,500 ($25,000 for joint filers) when they file their federal tax returns. This change provides a meaningful opportunity to reduce taxable income and boost tax refunds, but it doesn\u2019t alter how employers calculate and withhold taxes throughout the year.

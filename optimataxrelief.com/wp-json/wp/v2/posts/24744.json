These scenarios typically happen with improper tax withholding. Fortunately, there\u2019s a way to fix this. Understanding how to calculate your tax withholding so you don\u2019t owe or overpay can help you avoid tax time stress and keep your finances in better shape throughout the year.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Is Tax Withholding and How Does It Work?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/understanding-tax-withholding\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tax withholding<\/a> is the money your employer takes from your paycheck to prepay your estimated federal income tax obligation. This system ensures that taxes are paid gradually throughout the year, rather than in one lump sum on Tax Day. The amount withheld is based on information you provide to your employer on IRS Form W-4. That form tells your employer how much federal income tax to withhold based on your filing status, dependents, additional income, and other adjustments.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This system is also used by state and local governments, though rates and methods can vary. If you&#8217;re self-employed or have other income not subject to withholding\u2014such as rental income or investments\u2014you may need to make estimated tax payments in addition to adjusting withholding from a day job.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For employees, failing to manage withholding correctly can lead to two common outcomes. Under-withholding means you didn\u2019t have enough taken out and could face a tax bill or penalty. Over-withholding means you paid too much throughout the year and will receive a refund\u2014but essentially gave the IRS an interest-free loan.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why Getting Withholding Right Matters<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When your withholding aligns with your actual tax liability, you avoid unpleasant surprises and make better use of your money. Many people mistakenly believe that receiving a large tax refund is a sign of good financial planning. In reality, it often means you\u2019ve been giving up larger paychecks all year.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, if too little is withheld from your paycheck, you could owe hundreds or even thousands at tax time. That shortfall might also come with underpayment penalties. For 2025, the IRS imposes a penalty if you fail to pay at least 90% of your current tax bill or 100% of the prior year\u2019s liability (110% if your income was over $150,000).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine this: You\u2019re a single filer with one job and no children. If you owed $2,000 in taxes last year and have been withholding too little this year, you could be hit with a surprise bill and a penalty\u2014unless you catch the discrepancy early and adjust accordingly. By calculating your withholding ahead of time, you can make sure you\u2019re staying on track.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to Calculate the Right Withholding Amount<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Calculating your ideal withholding amount involves looking at your income, <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/which-filing-status-should-i-choose\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tax filing status<\/a>, any additional income streams, and deductions. It might sound complex, but it becomes manageable when you follow a few clear steps.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Gather Your Financial Information<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Start by collecting recent pay stubs for yourself and your spouse if you&#8217;re married. Look at year-to-date earnings and current withholding amounts. Pull out your last tax return to check your filing status, credits you claimed, and total tax liability. If you expect your situation to remain mostly the same, last year\u2019s return provides a solid baseline.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have side income, gig work, or freelance clients, estimate how much you expect to earn over the year and whether any taxes are currently being withheld. Don&#8217;t forget to consider investment income, alimony, or retirement distributions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Use the IRS Tax Withholding Estimator<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS provides a free and updated Tax Withholding Estimator, which is a powerful tool for getting personalized results. It walks you through a series of questions to estimate how much tax you will owe for the year and whether your current withholding is enough to cover that amount. However, note that this tool is not for those with nonresident alien status or those who have complex tax situations.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Section 1: About You<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS Tax Withholding Estimator will first ask your filing status and whether your job or pension regularly withholds federal income taxes from your paychecks or pension payments. It will also ask you to note if any of the following scenarios apply to you:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You plan to claim dependents on your tax return\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You will be 65 or older on January 1 of next year\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You are blind\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You can be claimed as a dependent on someone else\u2019s tax return\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Section 2: Income &amp; Withholding<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next section, you are asked to note how many jobs you will have this year in which federal income tax is regularly withheld. This includes this year&#8217;s past, present, and expected future jobs. You will answer questions about how you are paid, how often, how much per check, and how much you\u2019ve been paid so far this year. Use your most recent pay stub to find this information and be sure to enter the gross pay, or the pay before taxes and other deductions like your health insurance. This helps the estimator calculate how much tax should be withheld based on your total earnings, not what you take home.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will then enter the amount of federal taxes paid per pay period and the federal taxes paid year-to-date. Then note if any of the following scenarios apply to you:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You contribute to a <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/401k-options-for-the-self-employed\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">401(k)<\/a>, but not a Roth 401(k)\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You contribute to a health insurance plan, HSA, or FSA. You can include your employee health insurance premiums but only if they\u2019re paid with pre-tax dollars. Most employer-sponsored health insurance plans are pre-tax.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You are getting a bonus\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You got a bonus\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The next section requires you to note if you have other sources of income, including:&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Net self-employment income\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Investment income\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Unemployment insurance income\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Other sources of income (distributions from an IRA, scholarships, and alimony from pre-2019 divorce decrees.)\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, you will enter the amount of taxes withheld to date this year from your other sources of income. For example, some of the payers of these other income types may have withheld federal income tax for you. You will also enter the amount of estimated tax payments you made to date this year. Do not include estimated tax payments you plan to make later this year.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Section 3: Adjustments<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The Adjustments section of the withholding estimator helps you reduce the amount of your income subject to tax. Here you will note any adjustments to income you plan to make when you file your 2025 income taxes. Examples include:&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Self-employed health insurance deduction\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Contributions to self-employed SEP, SIMPLE, or other qualified plans\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Student Loan Interest Deduction\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Educator Expense Deduction\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Deduction for contributions to Traditional IRAs (not Roth IRAs or contributions from payroll)\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Health Savings Account Deduction (excluding amounts deducted from payroll)\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Moving Expenses for Members of the Armed Services\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Alimony paid\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Penalty for Early Withdrawal of Savings (certificate of deposit or other deferred interest account before maturity)\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Certain business credits for reservists, performing artists, and fee-based government officials\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>&nbsp;Section 4: Deductions<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next section, you will note if you plan to take the standard deduction or itemize. If you earned income through a business, it will also estimate your <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/what-is-the-qualified-business-income-deduction\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">qualified business income (QBI) deduction<\/a> based on what you have entered so far.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Section 5: Credits<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next section, you will select all the tax credits you plan to claim. Be sure you qualify before selecting them as this can impact your final result.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Section 6: Final Results<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The final section will yield your results and a summary of your withholding, whether it is enough, and what your projected tax liability will be. If it says you will owe additional tax, it will advise you step-by-step how to adjust your withholdings on Form W-4. If it says you will be due a refund, it will advise you how to submit a new Form W-4\/W-4P in order to increase your take-home pay. Note that the estimator tool result depends on the accuracy of your information. That said, make sure you have all the necessary documents and numbers to complete the estimator.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Update Your W-4 Form Accordingly<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you know what changes need to be made, complete a new W-4. The redesigned W-4 form introduced in 2020 removes withholding allowances and instead asks you to specify dollar amounts and additional income details.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>In Step 1, you\u2019ll confirm your filing status.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>In Step 2, indicate if you have multiple jobs or if both you and your spouse work.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Step 3 is where you enter the number of qualifying children and other dependents, applying the correct credit amounts.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"4\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Step 4 allows you to include other income not from jobs, claim deductions beyond the standard deduction, and request additional withholding.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"5\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Finally, Step 5 requires your signature.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If your goal is to avoid owing or overpaying, be as precise as possible when filling out each section. The IRS estimator often provides a suggested dollar amount for extra withholding per paycheck. You can enter that number in Step 4(c) to fine-tune your results.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Submit Your Updated W-4 to Your Employer<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After completing the W-4, submit it to your human resources or payroll department. Changes usually take effect within one to two pay periods. Monitor your pay stubs to confirm that the withholding adjustment has been implemented correctly. Remember, this isn\u2019t a one-and-done process. You should revisit your withholding anytime your financial or personal situation changes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Common Situations That Require Withholding Adjustments<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if your <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/how-to-fill-out-a-w-4\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">W-4<\/a> was perfect at the start of the year, life changes can throw things off course. If you recently got married or divorced, that affects your filing status and potentially your tax bracket. Adding a child to your family means you\u2019re likely eligible for new credits and deductions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other examples include getting a raise, changing jobs, or picking up freelance work. If you or your spouse starts receiving Social Security or retirement account distributions, those can impact your overall income and push you into a higher tax bracket.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider the case of a taxpayer who starts driving for a rideshare company on weekends. That income is not subject to automatic withholding, meaning they must either increase withholding from their day job or make estimated tax payments each quarter. Ignoring the extra income can result in a hefty tax bill come April.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tips to Avoid Owing or Overpaying in the Future<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The best approach to managing your withholding is being proactive and reviewing it periodically. At minimum, check your withholding status mid-year and again in the fall. This gives you time to make corrections before year-end.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those with variable income\u2014like freelancers or seasonal workers\u2014it may be helpful to set aside a percentage of each payment for taxes. You might use a separate savings account to hold tax money until it\u2019s time to pay. While it doesn\u2019t adjust your withholding directly, it keeps you from scrambling for cash later.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some taxpayers choose to withhold more than the recommended amount to create a built-in savings strategy, but this approach comes at the cost of reduced monthly cash flow. Instead, consider directing the extra funds into a high-yield savings account or IRA, where your money can earn interest or grow tax-deferred.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What to Do If You Still Owe or Overpaid<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you reach tax time and realize you owe the IRS, the first step is to pay the balance as quickly as possible to minimize interest and penalties. The IRS accepts payments via bank transfer, credit card, and payment plans. You may also want to review your W-4 immediately and make updates to prevent another shortfall the following year. The earlier in the year you adjust, the more effective the change will be.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you overpaid and are due a refund, file your return electronically and opt for direct deposit to receive your money faster. You can also adjust your W-4 to reduce future overpayments and keep more of your money in your paycheck. Remember, the goal is not necessarily a <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/why-is-receiving-a-large-tax-refund-a-bad-thing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">refund<\/a> or a zero balance\u2014it\u2019s accuracy. Whether you owe or are owed, the outcome should be intentional and planned.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Frequently Asked Questions<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Q: How do I change my withholdings to not owe taxes?<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A: To avoid owing taxes, use the IRS Tax Withholding Estimator to calculate the correct amount and submit an updated Form W-4 to your employer. Enter additional withholding in Step 4(c) or adjust income and deductions based on your results.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Q: What is a good percentage to withhold for taxes?<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A: A general rule is to withhold 10%\u201312% if you&#8217;re in a lower tax bracket, 22%\u201324% if you\u2019re middle income, and 32% or more for higher earners. However, the most accurate method is using the IRS estimator based on your actual income and filing status.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Q: What happens if no federal taxes are taken out of my paycheck?<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A: If no federal taxes are withheld and you owe taxes at year-end, you may face a large bill plus underpayment penalties. Unless you&#8217;re exempt from withholding, you should update your W-4 immediately to begin withholding the proper amount.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Q: What is backup withholding?<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A: <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/what-is-backup-withholding\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Backup withholding<\/a> is a flat 24% federal tax withheld from certain payments\u2014like interest, dividends, or freelance income\u2014when a taxpayer fails to provide a correct taxpayer identification number (TIN) or is flagged by the IRS for underreporting. It ensures the IRS still receives taxes owed in situations with potential noncompliance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tax Help with Withholding<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Figuring out how to calculate your withholding so you don\u2019t owe or overpay may seem overwhelming at first, but the process becomes much easier when broken into manageable steps. By using the IRS Tax Withholding Estimator, reviewing your W-4 regularly, and adjusting based on life changes, you can take full control of your tax outcome.

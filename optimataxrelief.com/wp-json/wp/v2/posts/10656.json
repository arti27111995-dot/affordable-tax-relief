However, there are many others who seek other accounts to fund their retirement years. When looking into retirement accounts, there are several factors to consider, one of the most important of them being taxes. Here are some tips on how to choose a retirement account based on how and when they are taxed.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Traditional IRA<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">An individual retirement account, or IRA, is an account that allows an individual to save for retirement with tax-free growth. A traditional IRA allows you to contribute pre-tax dollars and defer taxes until a withdrawal is made in retirement. It is a great option for those who expect to be in the same or lower tax bracket during retirement. You can contribute up to $6,500 for tax year 2023 and up to $7,000 in 2024. If you are aged 50 or older, you can contribute an additional $1,000 per year.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Traditional IRA Tax Implications&nbsp;<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">While anyone can open and contribute to a traditional IRA, not everyone can deduct contributions during tax time. The amount you can deduct will depend on two factors.<\/span> The first is <span data-contrast=\"auto\">whether you or your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/divorce-can-impact-your-tax-liability-who-is-responsible\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">spouse<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> contribute to a workplace retirement plan. The second is your income. The following groups do not qualify for a tax deduction.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Single or head of household filers who are covered by a workplace retirement plan, and who earned more than $<\/span>83<span data-contrast=\"auto\">,000 in 2023 or who will earn more than $8<\/span>7,<span data-contrast=\"auto\">000 in 202<\/span>4<span data-contrast=\"auto\">\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Married couples filing jointly who are covered by a workplace retirement plan, and who earned more than $1<\/span>36<span data-contrast=\"auto\">,000 in 202<\/span>3<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> or who will earn more than $<\/span>143,<span data-contrast=\"auto\">000 in 202<\/span>4<span data-contrast=\"auto\">\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Married couples filing jointly with one spouse covered by a workplace retirement plan, and who earned more than $2<\/span>28<span data-contrast=\"auto\">,000 in 202<\/span>3<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> or who will earn more than $2<\/span>40,<span data-contrast=\"auto\">000 in 202<\/span>4<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Married couples filing separately with at least one spouse covered by a workplace retirement plan, and who earned more than $10,000 in 202<\/span>3<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> or 202<\/span>4<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Most other groups will be eligible for either a partial or full deduction. As far as distributions go, it\u2019s important to note that you may only withdraw from a traditional IRA when you reach age 59 \u00bd. At that time, you\u2019ll begin paying regular income taxes on withdrawals. If you withdraw before age 59 \u00bd you may be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty.<\/span> However<span data-contrast=\"auto\">, t<\/span>hat is <span data-contrast=\"auto\">unless the money is used for certain expenses. There are also <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/what-are-required-minimum-distributions\/\">Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)<\/a> beginning at age 72.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Roth IRA<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A Roth IRA is an account that allows you to contribute after-tax dollars and then withdraw it tax-free in retirement. It\u2019s a great option for individuals who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future. The contribution limits are the same as a traditional IRA at $6,<\/span>5<span data-contrast=\"auto\">00 f<\/span>or 2023. May may withdraw <span data-contrast=\"auto\">an extra $1,000 if you are age 50 or older. The max contribution for 2024 i<\/span>s <span data-contrast=\"auto\">$<\/span>7,0<span data-contrast=\"auto\">00.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Unlike a traditional IRA, there are income limitations to open an account. H<\/span>owever, the income is based on your <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/agi-vs-magi\/\">modified adjusted gross income (MAGI)<\/a>. <span data-contrast=\"auto\">Single filers, heads of household, or married couples filing separately who did not live together during the tax year cannot <\/span>have a MAGI <span data-contrast=\"auto\">o<\/span>f <span data-contrast=\"auto\">$1<\/span>53<span data-contrast=\"auto\">,000 <\/span>or more <span data-contrast=\"auto\">to contribute to a Roth IRA <\/span>in tax year 2023<span data-contrast=\"auto\">.<\/span> The 2024 limit for these groups is $161,000.<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Married couples filing jointly, and qualifying widow(er)s cannot h<\/span>ave a MAGI of<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> $2<\/span>28<span data-contrast=\"auto\">,000<\/span> or more in 2023. This amount increased to $240,000 in 2024<span data-contrast=\"auto\">. Married couples filing separately who did live together during the tax year may not earn $10,000 <\/span>or more<span data-contrast=\"auto\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Roth IRA Tax Implications<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Since there are no RMDs for Roth IRA accounts, these accounts are typically preferred for those who plan to transfer their wealth to heirs, since it would also transfer the tax benefits. Any distributions taken by heirs will also be tax-free. <\/span>The main <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/roth-ira-penalties\/\">Roth IRA penalties<\/a> to watch out for are for early withdrawals, excess contributions, and failure to follow conversion rules.<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> <\/span>Finally, c<span data-contrast=\"auto\">ontributions made to a Roth IRA are taxed now.<\/span> This means<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> you may not claim a tax deduction for them during tax time.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Tax Relief for Those with Retirement Savings<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Deciding how to choose a retirement account will usually come down to when you want to pay taxes. With a traditional IRA, taxes will be paid in retirement.<\/span> On the other hand, a<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Roth IRA requires you to pay tax on the contributions now.

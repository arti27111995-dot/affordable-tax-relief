Constructively received income is income that is available to you before the end of the tax year. This could be in the form of cash or deposit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If an agent receives income on your behalf, this is called assignment of income. Assignment of income is still taxable, even if a third party is accepting your earnings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prepaid income is another taxable compensation that may include payment for future services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are royalties non-taxable income?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Copyrights, patents, and other properties such as oil and gas are examples of royalties. These items are taxable as income.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are business and investment earnings non-taxable?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Business earnings such as rental properties and other investments are very much taxable. Business owners are required to pay taxes quarterly to cover Social Security and Medicare tax.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While non-profit agencies are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.affordabletaxrelief.com\/may-16-filing-deadline-for-tax-exempt-organizations\/\">tax exempt<\/a>, you still have obligations to file a return.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What to do if you have a tax liability?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Taxable and non-taxable income can be a confusing topic. It\u2019s best to ask a professional for assistance if you\u2019re unsure about how or when to report income.

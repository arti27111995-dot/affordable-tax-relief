Issued by eligible educational institutions, this form provides details on tuition and related expenses. It is meant to help taxpayers determine their eligibility for valuable tax credits. Understanding Form 1098-T is essential for students and families looking to reduce their tax liability through education credits like the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) and the Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC). However, misinterpretations of the form can lead to errors or missed opportunities when filing taxes. This guide explains what Form 1098-T is, who receives it, how to use it, and common mistakes to avoid.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is Form 1098-T?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Form 1098-T, Tuition Statement, is an IRS tax form issued by colleges, universities, and other eligible educational institutions. It reports payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses. It also reports <a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/blog\/do-scholarships-and-grants-affect-my-taxes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">scholarships and grants<\/a> that may offset those costs. The information provided on this form helps student taxpayers determine whether they qualify for certain education-related tax benefits.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary purpose of Form 1098-T is to assist taxpayers in claiming education credits. However, receiving this form does not automatically mean that a taxpayer qualifies for a credit. The amounts listed must be carefully reviewed in conjunction with IRS requirements to determine eligibility.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Who Receives Form 1098-T?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Form 1098-T is issued to students who have paid qualified tuition and related expenses during the tax year. The form is typically provided to U.S. citizens and resident aliens attending an eligible educational institution.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some students may not receive a 1098-T even if they paid tuition. This can happen in situations where the institution is not required to issue the form. An example is when an employer or another third party covers tuition costs. Additionally, students enrolled in non-degree programs or those taking courses for personal enrichment rather than as part of a degree-seeking program may not be eligible to receive the form.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Understanding the Key Boxes on Form 1098-T<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Form 1098-T contains several key boxes that provide crucial information about tuition payments, scholarships, and adjustments. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the most important sections of the form and what they mean for <a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/blog\/student-loans-and-taxes-what-current-students-graduates-need-to-know\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">students<\/a> and parents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Box 1: Payments Received for Qualified Tuition and Related Expenses<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Box 1 reports the total amount of qualified tuition and related expenses paid during the tax year. These expenses typically include tuition and required fees. However, they do not cover costs such as room and board, insurance, or transportation. It is important to note that the amount reported in this box may not necessarily reflect what the student personally paid, as it may include amounts covered by financial aid or loans.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Box 2: Amounts Billed (No Longer Used)<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to 2018, some institutions reported amounts billed for tuition and expenses instead of payments received. The IRS removed this option, so Box 2 is now left blank.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Box 5: Scholarships and Grants<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Box 5 reports the total amount of scholarships and grants the student received. This amount is crucial because scholarships and grants can reduce the amount of qualified expenses that are eligible for education credits. If scholarships and grants exceed tuition and qualified expenses, the excess may be considered taxable income.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Box 6: Adjustments to Prior-Year Amounts<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If there were any adjustments made to tuition payments or scholarships from a prior year, they will be reported in Box 6. These adjustments can affect prior-year tax returns, potentially requiring an amendment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to Use Form 1098-T for Taxes<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Form 1098-T plays a major role in claiming education-related tax benefits. The two most commonly claimed credits are the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) and the Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC)<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The AOTC allows eligible taxpayers to claim up to $2,500 per student for the first four years of higher education. To qualify, the student must be pursuing a degree, be enrolled at least half-time, and not have completed the first four years of postsecondary education. Up to 40% of the credit is refundable, meaning that even if a taxpayer has no tax liability, they could receive up to $1,000 as a refund.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC)<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/blog\/what-is-the-lifetime-learning-credit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">LLC<\/a> provides a credit of up to $2,000 per tax return for qualified education expenses. Unlike the AOTC, the LLC has no limit on the number of years it can be claimed and applies to undergraduate, graduate, and professional degree courses. However, it is non-refundable, meaning it can only reduce tax liability but will not result in a refund. For example, consider a student who pays $10,000 in tuition and receives a $4,000 scholarship. The remaining $6,000 may be used to calculate education credits. If the student qualifies for the AOTC, they could receive up to $2,500 in tax savings.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Common Issues and What to Watch Out For<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Errors and misunderstandings related to Form 1098-T can lead to incorrect tax filings or missed opportunities for education credits. One common issue arises when the amount in Box 1 does not match what the taxpayer believes they paid. This discrepancy can occur because the form only reflects payments received during the tax year, which may not align with the academic calendar. For example, if a student paid spring semester tuition in December, it will appear on the previous year\u2019s 1098-T.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scholarships and grants reported in Box 5 can also impact a taxpayer\u2019s ability to claim education credits. If a student\u2019s scholarships exceed tuition and qualified expenses, the excess amount may be taxable income and should be reported accordingly. <a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/blog\/i-overstated-my-tax-deductions-now-what\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Misreporting<\/a> this can lead to IRS notices or audits.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another issue is assuming that receiving Form 1098-T automatically qualifies the student for a tax credit. The taxpayer must meet all IRS requirements, and qualified expenses should be carefully calculated, excluding costs such as room and board.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What to Do If You Don\u2019t Receive a 1098-T<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If a student expects to receive Form 1098-T but does not, they should first contact their school\u2019s financial aid or accounting office. In some cases, students may not receive the form because their tuition was fully covered by scholarships, or because they were enrolled in a non-degree program. If the school confirms that no form was issued, students can still claim eligible education expenses using other records such as tuition statements, receipts, and bank statements.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tax Help for Students<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Form 1098-T is an essential document for students and parents seeking education-related tax benefits. While it provides a summary of tuition payments and financial aid, taxpayers must carefully review the information to ensure they accurately claim credits like the AOTC and LLC. Understanding how to use the form, recognizing common issues, and knowing what steps to take if the form is missing can help taxpayers maximize their education tax benefits and avoid potential filing errors. Consulting a tax professional can also be beneficial in complex situations, ensuring that students and their families make the most of available tax-saving opportunities.

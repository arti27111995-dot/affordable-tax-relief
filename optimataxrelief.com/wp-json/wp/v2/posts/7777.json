An exception would be considered if a taxpayer fails to file a return or files a fraudulent return. In either case, the IRS would have an unlimited amount of time to assess tax for the tax years in question.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The IRS generally has 10 years from the date of assessment to collect unpaid taxes. It is important for a taxpayer to know that the 10-year period cannot be extended unless a taxpayer enters into a payment plan or the IRS obtains court judgments.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A 10-year collection period may be suspended when the IRS cannot collect money because a taxpayer has an ongoing bankruptcy or there\u2019s a collection due process proceeding involving the taxpayer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A taxpayer will only be subject to one audit per tax year.

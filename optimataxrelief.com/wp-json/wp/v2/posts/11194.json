HSAs are<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> tax-advantaged savings accounts specifically designed for individuals with high-deductible health plans (HDHPs). For those who do not have an HDHP, there are other options when it comes to paying for medical expenses. Enter flexible savings accounts, or FSAs<\/span>.<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> T<\/span>hese <span data-contrast=\"auto\">can help cover the cost of health care expenses, all while saving you money during tax time. Here\u2019s an overview of flexible spending accounts, including what they are, how they work, and their tax benefits that can save you money.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What is a Flexible Spending Account (FSA)?<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Like a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/tax-benefits-of-health-savings-accounts\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">health savings account<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> (HSA), a flexible spending account (FSA) is a tax-advantaged savings account used to pay for qualified medical expenses. In addition, FSA contributions are made with pre-tax dollars<\/span>. This basically<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> means contributions are not included in your taxable income, thus reducing your tax liability for the year. Unlike an HSA, contributions made to your FSA do not carry over to the next year<\/span>. I<span data-contrast=\"auto\">nstead,<\/span> they<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> use a \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d policy. This means that any<\/span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">funds that are unspent by the end of each plan year are\u00a0forfeited to your employer.\u00a0However, your employer may offer some exceptions to this rule. For example, some employers might give you an additional grace period of an extra 2.5 months to use the funds or allow up to $610 to carry over into the following year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In 2023, the IRS allows you to contribute up to $3,050 to your FSA if you\u2019re a single person. If you are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/marriage-bonuses-vs-marriage-penalties\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">married<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, your spouse may also contribute the same amount through their own employer. Although they are not required to, your employer may also contribute to your personal FSA. FSA<\/span>s<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> can cover things like medical deductibles, first aid supplies, eyeglasses, contact lenses, some dental expenses, copayments, some prescriptions drugs, and coinsurance.<\/span> However<span data-contrast=\"auto\">, <\/span>note that <span data-contrast=\"auto\">all FSA-eligible expenses are determined by the IRS. Unlike HSAs, FSAs are typically owned by the employer or the FSA administrator. When you leave your job, you generally lose access to your FSA.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">How Does an FSA Work?<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">During your employer&#8217;s open enrollment, you <\/span>can<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> sign up for an FSA. You&#8217;ll need to decide how much money you want to contribute to the account for the upcoming plan year. Once you&#8217;ve enrolled in the FSA, your chosen contribution amount will be deducted from your paycheck on a pre-tax basis. As you incur eligible <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/what-medical-expenses-are-tax-deductible\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">medical expenses<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> throughout the year, you access your FSA <\/span>funds<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> to pay for them. Your employer will <\/span>typically <span data-contrast=\"auto\">provide you with a payment card, w<\/span>hich is <span data-contrast=\"auto\">similar to a debit card<\/span>. Alternatively, they may have a <span data-contrast=\"auto\">reimbursement procedure to access the funds. You are liable for paying back your account if the benefits card is unintentionally or knowingly used for ineligible costs.\u00a0Any unspent funds in your FSA at the end of the plan year may be forfeited. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Pre-Tax Contributions<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">While contributions to your FSA are not tax-deductible like those of an HSA, they are deposited pre-tax<\/span>. So, contributions<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> lower your total tax liability. For example, l<\/span>et&#8217;s say <span data-contrast=\"auto\">your annual salary is $50,000 and you contribute $3,000 to your FSA.<\/span> Consequently, y<span data-contrast=\"auto\">our gross income would then be $47,000. Any taxes owed, whether they are federal, state, or local,\u00a0would be based on the gross amount. Because these funds are not taxed, you cannot claim a tax deduction for your contributions. However, FSA participants have an average 30% tax savings on the total amount they contribute to their account. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">FSAs vs. HSAs<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">HSAs and FSAs are both popular tools for managing healthcare expenses, but they have some key differences.<\/span> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>FSAs<\/em><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Generally available to employees<\/span> with employers who offer these accounts<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">FSAs have lower contribution limits, with the maximum annual contribution limit of $2,850 per individual in 2023.

This notice is a reminder from the IRS regarding an outstanding tax debt and offers information about what actions you can take to address the issue. Here&#8217;s what you need to know about Notice CP71C and the steps you should take if it arrives in your mailbox.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is IRS Notice CP71C?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>IRS Notice CP71C is an annual statement sent to taxpayers who <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/how-much-do-i-owe-the-irs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">owe federal tax<\/a>. It&#8217;s not a bill but a reminder notice, typically sent out once a year, outlining the unpaid balance, including interest and penalties accrued on the account. The notice is a way for the IRS to keep you informed about the status of your debt and to remind you of the various options available for resolving it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why Did You Receive This Notice?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You received IRS Notice CP71C because the IRS has records indicating that you have an outstanding tax debt that has not been fully resolved. The notice serves several purposes:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Annual Reminder: <\/strong>To remind you of the existing tax debt and its current amount.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Detailing Penalties and Interest:<\/strong> To inform you of any <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/common-irs-penalties-and-how-to-avoid-them\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">penalties<\/a> and interest that have accumulated on the unpaid balance.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Informing You of Payment Options:<\/strong> To make you aware of possible options for paying off the debt or setting up a payment plan.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Understanding the Contents of the Notice<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Notice CP71C contains essential information about your tax debt. Here&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll typically find on the notice.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Amount Owed:<\/strong> The total balance due, including the original tax owed, plus any penalties and interest.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Payment Instructions:<\/strong> Details on how to make a payment to the IRS.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Possible Consequences:<\/strong> Information on what may happen if the debt remains unpaid, such as additional penalties, interest, or potential collection actions like <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/what-you-need-to-know-about-irs-wage-levies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">wage garnishment<\/a> or levies.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Contact Information: <\/strong>A phone number and contact details if you need to speak with an IRS representative for further clarification or assistance.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Steps to Take If You Receive IRS Notice CP71C<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Receiving any IRS notice can be intimidating. However, it\u2019s crucial to remember what actions need to be taken to fully understand your tax situation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Review the Notice Carefully<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Read through the notice thoroughly to understand the amount owed and the breakdown of any penalties and interest. Compare the information on the notice with your own tax records to ensure its accuracy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Verify the Debt<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensure that the tax debt mentioned on the notice is correct. If you believe there is an error or you have already paid the debt, you may need to gather supporting documentation and contact the IRS for clarification.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Consider Payment Options<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The notice will outline different payment options available to you, such as paying the full amount, setting up a monthly payment plan, or exploring other options like an Offer in Compromise. Choose the option that best fits your financial situation:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Full Payment: <\/strong>If possible, paying the full amount will stop further penalties and interest from accruing.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Installment Agreement:<\/strong> If you cannot pay the full amount, setting up a payment plan with the IRS can allow you to pay off the debt over time.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Offer in Compromise: <\/strong>If you qualify, you might be able to <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/offer-in-compromise\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">settle your tax debt for less<\/a> than the full amount owed.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Contact the IRS if Necessary<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need to discuss your options, dispute the debt, or set up a payment plan, contact the IRS using the phone number provided on the notice. It\u2019s essential to reach out to the IRS promptly to avoid further penalties or enforcement actions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Seek Professional Assistance<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re uncertain about how to handle the notice or if the amount owed is substantial, consider seeking help from a tax professional. They can provide guidance tailored to your situation and help you navigate the process.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Keep Records<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep a copy of the notice and any correspondence or payment confirmations related to your tax debt. Proper documentation is essential in case there are any disputes or issues in the future.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Ignoring IRS Notice CP71C Can Lead to Serious Consequences<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ignoring this IRS notice won&#8217;t make the debt go away. If the tax debt remains unpaid, the IRS can take more aggressive actions to collect the amount owed. These actions can include placing a lien on your property, garnishing your wages, or <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/what-you-need-to-know-about-irs-bank-levies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">levying your bank account<\/a>. Addressing the notice promptly can help you avoid these potential consequences. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tax Help for Those Who Received IRS Notice CP71C<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Receiving IRS Notice CP71C is a reminder of an existing tax debt, not an immediate threat. However, it does indicate that the IRS expects you to take action to resolve the outstanding balance. By reviewing the notice carefully, verifying the debt, exploring payment options, and possibly seeking professional help, you can take the necessary steps to address the situation and avoid further complications.

Once we receive your request and confirm your identity (see <strong><a href=\"#rights\">Exercising Your Rights to Know, Delete, or Correct<\/a><\/strong>), we will review your request to determine if the information we maintain about you is in accurate based on the totality of the circumstances. We may require you to provide documentation to demonstrate that the information we maintain about you is inaccurate. We may deny your request if:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The personal information we maintain about you is more likely than not accurate based on the totality of the circumstances.<\/li>\n<li>We have denied your request to correct the same alleged inaccuracy within the past six months of receiving the request.<\/li>\n<li>We have a good-faith, reasonable, and documented belief that a request to correct is fraudulent or abusive.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If we determine that your request is valid and the personal information we maintain about you is inaccurate, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the inaccurate personal information existing in our systems. Alternatively, we may delete the alleged inaccurate personal information instead of correcting the information if the deletion of the personal information does not negatively impact you, or you consent to the deletion. On request, we shall disclose the specific pieces of personal information that we maintain and have collected about you to allow you to confirm that we have corrected the inaccurate information that was the subject of your request to correct.<\/p>\n<h4><em>Exercising Your Rights to Know, Delete, or Correct<\/em><\/h4>\n<p>To exercise your rights to know, delete, or correct described above, please submit a request by either:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Calling us at (800)536-0734.<\/li>\n<li>Emailing us at privacy@optimataxrelief.com.<\/li>\n<li>Visiting https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/about-us\/privacy\/.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a request to know, delete, or correct related to your personal information. To designate an authorized agent, you must provide us with a valid Power of Attorney granting your authorized agent the authority to act on your behalf with regard to tax and legal matters, including the right to make information requests pursuant to California law.<\/p>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect, sell, share, or retain personal information of persons under the age of 18. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 16, we will delete that information. If you believe that we might have any personal information about a child under 16, you may also make a request to know, delete, or correct on behalf of your child using the submission methods designated above.<\/p>\n<p>You may only submit a request to know twice within a 12-month period. Your request to know, delete, or correct must:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, which may include:\n<ul>\n<li>First and last name;<\/li>\n<li>Address;<\/li>\n<li>Phone number; and<\/li>\n<li>Last four digits of your Social Security number.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.<\/p>\n<p>You do not need to create an account with us to submit a request to know, delete, or correct. However, we do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to personal information associated with that specific account.<\/p>\n<p>We will only use personal information provided in the request to verify the requestor&#8217;s identity or authority to make it.<\/p>\n<h4><\/h4>\n<h4><em>Response Timing and Format<\/em><\/h4>\n<p>We will confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) business days. If you do not receive confirmation within the 10-day timeframe, please contact our privacy team at <a href=\"mailto:privacy@optimataxrelief.com\">privacy@optimataxrelief.com<\/a>, or call us at (800)536-0734.<\/p>\n<p>We endeavor to substantively respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to another 45 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.<\/p>\n<p>If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.<\/p>\n<p>Any disclosures we provide will cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request. We will endeavor to provide disclosures beyond the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request unless doing so proves impossible or would involve disproportionate effort, or you request data for a specific time period. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable, including any explanation as to why we cannot provide disclosures beyond the 12-month period, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.<\/p>\n<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.<\/p>\n<h4><em>Non-Discrimination and Non-Retaliation<\/em><\/h4>\n<p>We will not discriminate against you or retaliate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deny you goods or services.<\/li>\n<li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.<\/li>\n<li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.<\/li>\n<li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.<\/li>\n<li>Retaliate against you if you are an employee, job applicant, or independent contractor.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information&#8217;s value and contain written terms that describe the program&#8217;s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program would require your prior opt-in consent, which you would be able to revoke at any time. We currently do not provide any financial incentives in exchange for the collection, sale, sharing, or retention of personal information.<\/p>\n<h3>Changes to Our Privacy Policy<\/h3>\n<p>We reserve the right to amend this privacy policy at our discretion and at any time.

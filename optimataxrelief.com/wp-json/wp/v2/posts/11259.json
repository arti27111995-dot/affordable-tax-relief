Now that we have a good understanding of what <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/1099s-explained-types\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">types of 1099s<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> there are and what they are used for, we can review some of the most frequently asked questions about them. Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about IRS Form 1099.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What if I mistakenly received a 1099?<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you received a 1099 by mistake, or if t<\/span>he amounts reported are incorrect<span data-contrast=\"auto\">, you should report the error to the payer immediately. If you\u2019re lucky, they\u2019ll be able to correct the error before sending a copy to the IRS. On the other hand, if they already have sent the 1099 to the IRS, you\u2019ll need to request they send a corrected form. Spotting an error quickly will give you the best chance at avoiding further complications. That said, knowing which 1099s to expect in advance, and knowing the expected amount shown on them, can help you catch mistakes early on.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Do I need to report every 1099 I receive?<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Every 1099 you receive should be considered in your tax return. This is because the IRS also receives a copy of each of your 1099s as well. For example, you must include all income earned through 1099-NEC, 1099-MISC, 1099-K, 1099-DIV, and others that report income. However, let\u2019s say you receive 1099-S after the sale of your home. Remember, if the property was your primary residence for two of the five years before the sale, then up to $250,000 of the profit is exempt from taxes. This amount increases to $500,000 for married couples filing jointly. In this scenario, the transaction is not reportable. However, you will need to submit a written certification stating why you are exempt from capital gains on the transaction. Be sure to always consult with a knowledgeable tax professional about your reporting requirements.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What\u2019s the difference between a 1099 and a W-2?<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/1099-explained-the-basics\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">1099 form<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> reports any income earned outside of regular employer income. It is commonly received by independent contractors, gig workers, and investors. A W-2 reports wages earned through an employer for the year. The biggest difference between the two forms is that the W-2 shows any taxes withheld from your wages, while the 1099 does not. That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re off the hook though. If you earn income through 1099s, you should be making estimated tax payments each quarter since the IRS requires taxes to be paid as income is earned. Failing to pay estimated taxes on 1099 income can result in penalties, interest and surprise tax bills. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What changes are coming for the 1099-K?<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Previously, taxpayers only received a 1099-K, Payment Card and Third-Party Network Transactions, if they received over $20,000 in aggregate payments over 200 transactions through third-party payment networks, like Venmo or PayPal. For the 2024 tax year, the <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/irs-announces-delay-in-1099-k-reporting\/\">1099-K reporting threshold<\/a> was reduced down to just $<\/span>5,0<span data-contrast=\"auto\">00 in aggregate payments. <\/span>Tax year 2025 will see this amount drop to $600. <span data-contrast=\"auto\">The IRS is expecting many more taxpayers to receive a 1099-K by the January 31st deadline, but with some hiccups along the way. For example, you may mistakenly receive a 1099-K for non-business transactions<\/span>. Common scenarios may be<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> collecting rent money from a roommate or receiving a friend\u2019s portion of a dinner bill. In this case, it is up to you to contact the filer to request a corrected form. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What if I have more questions about 1099s?<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">We can\u2019t stress enough just how complex 1099s can be.

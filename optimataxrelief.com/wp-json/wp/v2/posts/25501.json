But here\u2019s the good news: a denial doesn\u2019t always mean it\u2019s over. You can reapply for an OIC, and in some cases, you can even appeal the IRS\u2019s decision before starting over. The key is understanding why your offer was denied, how the appeal process works, and what changes you\u2019ll need to make for a successful reapplication. This guide will walk you through every step, from recognizing the type of denial you received to strengthening your new application. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Understanding OIC Denials<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before deciding whether to appeal or reapply, it\u2019s important to know exactly what kind of denial you\u2019ve received. Not all <a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/blog\/my-oic-was-rejected-now-what\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OIC rejections<\/a> are treated the same way, and the IRS uses specific terminology that can determine your next step.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Returned vs. Rejected Offers<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS can return an OIC without even reviewing it if you fail to meet certain procedural requirements. For example, an offer may be returned if you:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Fail to include the $205 application fee (unless you qualify for a low-income waiver)\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Miss required financial documentation\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Haven\u2019t filed all required tax returns\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Don\u2019t make the initial payment that\u2019s required with your offer\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>When an offer is returned, you cannot appeal it. Your only option is to fix the issue and submit a brand-new application. Think of this like a college application that never made it to the admissions committee because you forgot to send your transcripts; it wasn\u2019t evaluated, so there\u2019s nothing to appeal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A rejected offer, on the other hand, means the IRS has reviewed your application but decided your offer doesn\u2019t meet their acceptance criteria. This often happens if:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Your offer amount is lower than your Reasonable Collection Potential (RCP), which is the IRS\u2019s calculation of your ability to pay\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Your financial disclosures are incomplete or inaccurate\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You\u2019re not current with tax filings or estimated payments\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The IRS believes your future income will allow you to pay more than you offered\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>When an offer is rejected, you can either appeal or reapply. Which one you choose depends on your specific situation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Your Right to Appeal a Rejected OIC<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An appeal can be your fastest route to reversing a denial without starting from scratch. But it\u2019s a time-sensitive process with strict rules.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Eligibility and Time Constraints<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Only rejected OICs (not returned ones) can be appealed. Once you receive your rejection letter, you have 30 days to request an appeal. This deadline is non-negotiable. If you miss it, you\u2019ll need to file a completely new OIC. Appeals are made by submitting Form 13711, Request for Appeal of Offer in Compromise, or by sending a formal written protest that includes all required elements.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Appeal Components and Strategy<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To strengthen your appeal, you should include:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A copy of the rejection letter\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Your name, address, and taxpayer identification number\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The tax periods involved\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A clear statement that you\u2019re appealing the decision\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Specific items you disagree with, along with your reasons\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Supporting documentation that backs up your claims\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Your signature, along with a statement that your appeal is true and correct under penalty of perjury\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The most effective appeals target specific errors in the IRS\u2019s reasoning. For example, if the IRS claims you can liquidate an asset for $15,000 but a recent appraisal shows it\u2019s worth only $8,000, submit that appraisal. If they overestimated your monthly disposable income by counting temporary income sources, provide evidence to correct it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>What to Expect in the Appeal Process<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you file an appeal, your case is reviewed by an independent Appeals Officer who was not involved in the initial decision. They may contact you for additional documentation or clarification.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the appeal:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/blog\/how-does-the-irs-collections-process-work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Collection actions<\/a> are paused. The IRS generally won\u2019t levy your assets while your appeal is pending.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The Appeals Officer may negotiate. Sometimes they\u2019ll suggest a counter-offer instead of a full rejection.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You\u2019ll receive a written decision either upholding or reversing the original rejection.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If the appeal doesn\u2019t work out, you can still reapply. In this case, at least you\u2019ll have a better understanding of what the IRS wants to see.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Reapplying for a New OIC<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let\u2019s discuss what happens when you reapply for an OIC.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Is Reapplication Allowed?<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, there\u2019s no formal waiting period to reapply after an OIC rejection. However, the IRS will expect to see meaningful changes in your new application. If you simply resubmit the same offer without adjustments, the IRS can reject it immediately as frivolous.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>When to Reapply<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Reapplication makes sense if:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Your financial situation has changed. For example, if you\u2019ve lost a job, your income has dropped, or you\u2019ve taken on unavoidable medical expenses, you could reapply.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Your assets have depreciated. If property values or investments have fallen, your RCP may be lower now.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You\u2019ve resolved compliance issues, such as filing all past-due returns or making current tax payments.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You\u2019re approaching the statute of limitations on IRS collections, meaning the IRS may be more willing to compromise.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, suppose the IRS rejected your offer last year because you were making $75,000 a year. If you\u2019re now earning $50,000 and have higher living expenses, you may qualify for a lower RCP and have a better chance at approval.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>How to Reapply<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Reapplying means submitting a new Form 656 along with an updated Form 433-A (OIC) for individuals or Form 433-B (OIC) for businesses. You\u2019ll also need to:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Include the $205 application fee (unless you qualify for a waiver)\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Make the initial payment required for your chosen payment option\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Ensure all tax returns are filed and you\u2019re current on any payment obligations\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you previously appealed, your new application must be complete and accurate. Do not assume the IRS will refer back to your prior paperwork.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Improving Your Offer<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To make your reapplication stronger:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Offer closer to your RCP:<\/strong> If the IRS calculated your RCP at $20,000 and you offered $10,000, consider raising your offer to meet or approach that figure.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Justify a lower RCP: <\/strong>If you can prove the IRS\u2019s calculation was too high, include new documentation. This can include lower asset valuations, proof of unreimbursed medical expenses, or updated pay stubs.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Show financial hardship:<\/strong> If paying more than your offer would cause undue <a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/blog\/my-irs-levy-is-causing-a-hardship-now-what\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hardship<\/a>, document this with bills, receipts, and letters from service providers.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS is more likely to approve an offer when you provide a clear, well-supported case for why the amount you\u2019re offering is truly the most they can collect.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Alternatives When an OIC Isn\u2019t Viable<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if reapplying isn\u2019t the right move, or if you\u2019re denied again, you still have options to address your tax debt.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Installment Agreement<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An installment agreement allows you to pay your tax debt over time. While you\u2019ll still owe the full amount (plus interest), it can make the debt more manageable by breaking it into monthly payments.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Currently Not Collectible (CNC) Status<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your financial situation is so dire that you can\u2019t make any payments, you may qualify for CNC status. This temporarily stops IRS collection activity, though interest and penalties will continue to accrue.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Penalty Abatement<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If penalties make up a significant portion of your debt, you might qualify for <a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/blog\/what-is-irs-penalty-abatement\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">penalty abatement<\/a>, especially if you have a reasonable cause such as a serious illness or natural disaster.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Innocent Spouse Relief<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your tax debt stems from your spouse\u2019s (or ex-spouse\u2019s) actions, you may qualify for relief that removes your responsibility for part or all of the debt.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Recommendations and Best Practices<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking the right steps after an Offer in Compromise denial can make all the difference in your chances of success.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Review the Rejection Carefully<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The rejection letter should include details on why your OIC was denied. Look closely at any financial worksheets or asset valuations included. These documents are the IRS\u2019s roadmap for calculating your RCP. Often, they reveal opportunities to challenge or adjust the numbers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Act Quickly<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you\u2019re appealing or reapplying, time is critical. Appeals must be filed within 30 days, and financial circumstances can change, sometimes making your case stronger, sometimes weaker.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Document Everything<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>IRS decisions often hinge on documentation. Appraisals, medical bills, repair estimates, and income statements can all be decisive in lowering your RCP or proving hardship.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Seek Professional Help<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A tax attorney or enrolled agent experienced in OIC cases can spot weaknesses in your application, negotiate with the IRS, and help ensure your offer meets all procedural and financial requirements. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Frequently Asked Questions<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>What happens if my offer in compromise is rejected?<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your offer in compromise is rejected, you can either file an appeal within 30 days to challenge the IRS\u2019s decision or reapply with a stronger offer and updated financial information.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>How many times can I apply for an offer in compromise?<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can apply for an offer in compromise as many times as needed, but each new application should include meaningful changes in your financial situation or offer amount to avoid automatic rejection.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>How likely is the IRS to accept an offer in compromise?<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS accepts less than half of OICs, typically when the offer reasonably reflects the taxpayer\u2019s ability to pay and is supported by complete financial disclosure and hardship evidence.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>What is the IRS Fresh Start Program?<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/blog\/what-is-the-irs-fresh-start-program\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">IRS Fresh Start Program<\/a> provides tax relief options, including expanded installment agreements and offers in compromise, designed to help struggling taxpayers resolve debts more easily.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>What does the IRS look at for an offer in compromise?<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS evaluates your Reasonable Collection Potential (RCP) by reviewing your income, expenses, assets, and ability to pay to determine if your offer is the most they can reasonably collect.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tax-help-with-oics-nbsp\"><strong>Tax Help with OICs<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, can you reapply for an Offer in Compromise after it\u2019s denied?

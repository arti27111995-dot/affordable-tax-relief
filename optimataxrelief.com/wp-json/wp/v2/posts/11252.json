With the additional income comes a different tax filing process. If you receive a 1099, it\u2019s because you earned a certain amount of income from a non-employer<\/span>. L<span data-contrast=\"auto\">ike most income, 1099 income is taxable. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the basics of the IRS 1099 form.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What is a 1099?<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">IRS Form 1099 is actually a collection of tax forms, and not just one single form. If you receive a 1099 form, it means that the sender paid you a certain amount of money, usually at least $600, in the previous year. These funds could be from income you received as an independent contractor,\u00a0rental\u00a0income, dividend payouts, and more.<\/span> These forms serve as a record of payments made to individuals or entities during the tax year. They are used by businesses, banks, and other institutions to inform both the recipient and the IRS of income that may be subject to taxation. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/a-breakdown-of-irs-form-w-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">W-2 forms<\/a>, which report wages and withhold payroll taxes, 1099s generally do not have federal or state taxes withheld. Recipients are responsible for calculating and paying any taxes owed on this income, often through estimated tax payments. For example, a freelance graphic designer completes a project for a company and is paid $2,000. They will likely receive a 1099-NEC reporting that payment. The company issuing the form does not withhold taxes. The freelancer must account for self-employment taxes and income taxes when filing their return.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Who receives a 1099?<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Many individuals and businesses receive 1099 forms if they have earned qualifying income.

If you have not received a 1099 by early February but expect one, you should follow up with the issuer. On the other hand, if you receive a 1099 that&#8217;s incorrect, you should contact the payer to request a corrected form. If the issue is not resolved, you can still report the correct income on your tax return and attach an explanation if necessary. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What if I don\u2019t receive a 1099 for income I earned?<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you do not receive a 1099, you are still responsible for reporting all taxable income to the IRS. The absence of a form does not exempt you from paying taxes on that income. For example, if a freelancer earns $500 from a single client, the client may not issue a 1099-NEC because they did not meet the $600 threshold. However, the freelancer must still report the income on their tax return.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To avoid underreporting, individuals should keep detailed records of all payments received throughout the year. Bank statements, invoices, and payment app records can serve as proof of income when preparing a tax return. Failing to report income, even if no 1099 was received, can lead to penalties and potential IRS audits. The IRS receives copies of 1099s from businesses and financial institutions, so any discrepancies between reported income and IRS records can trigger scrutiny.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s critical to <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/what-documents-do-i-need-to-file-my-taxes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">wait for all tax forms before filing your tax return<\/a>. If you are still waiting for a 1099 <s>after the deadline<\/s> and the tax deadline is approaching, reach out to the payer responsible for sending it and request a copy be sent to you. Be sure to give yourself enough time to request and receive the 1099 copy to avoid submitting a late tax return.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to File Taxes with a 1099<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When filing a tax return, 1099 income must be reported in the appropriate section. Freelancers and independent contractors report their earnings on Schedule C, where they can also deduct business expenses. Investors report capital gains and losses on Schedule D, while interest and dividends are recorded on Schedule B. Since 1099 income often does not have taxes withheld, recipients may need to make estimated tax payments throughout the year to avoid penalties. These payments are made quarterly to the IRS and help cover income taxes and self-employment taxes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to note that the amounts shown on 1099s represent gross income before expenses. If you\u2019re self-employed, you can deduct legitimate business expenses on Schedule C, which reduces your taxable income. Expenses can include supplies, software, marketing, and travel related to your work. For example, if your 1099-NEC shows $10,000 of income, but you spent $2,000 on necessary business expenses, you only pay taxes on $8,000. Investors use Schedule D to report capital gains and losses from amounts shown on 1099-DIV or 1099-B, while interest and dividends are reported on Schedule B.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Common Mistakes to Avoid with 1099s<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common mistake to avoid with 1099s is to omit the income from your tax return or report it late. If you discover an error after filing, you should amend your return as soon as possible using Form 1040-X. For example, failing to report a $5,000 1099 could result in an underpayment penalty, which increases the longer the tax remains unpaid. Filing an amended return promptly can help minimize additional charges.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another common error is overlooking 1099 forms that arrive late or get misplaced. Since the IRS receives copies of all 1099s issued to you, failing to include reported income can trigger an audit. Always review your tax documents thoroughly and cross-reference them with your records. Finally, misunderstanding the difference between gross and net income can be a common issue. Only deduct expenses that are ordinary and necessary for your <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/how-to-report-a-business-loss-on-your-tax-return\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">business<\/a> and keep receipts and documentation in case of an audit. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Tax Help for Those Who Receive Form 1099<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Overall, understanding the 1099 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/irs-tax-forms\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">form<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> is important for anyone who receives income from sources other than an employer.

Some taxpayers may receive a certified letter in the mail from the IRS after filing their tax return notifying them of a balance due or that some information was missing on their tax return. If you\u2019ve received a notice from the IRS, don\u2019t panic, there are options available to you that the IRS offers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You owe a tax balance.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve already filed your taxes and owed a tax balance that you have yet to pay off, the IRS will send a notice regarding the debt as well as the penalties and interest that have accrued in addition to your balance. For those taxpayers who are unable to pay their tax liability in full, the IRS offers installment payments that can be made over a period of time in order to satisfy your debt. The IRS will typically present you with a payment plan based on the income that was provided on your tax return. If your income has changed or you are unable to afford the payment plan that was presented to you, it is recommended that you consult with a tax professional to see what additional options you may have.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Information is missing on your tax return.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Failing to provide all relevant information on your tax return could result in you receiving a certified letter from the IRS notifying you that information was missing and they need further assistance from you in order to process your return. Typically this letter is sent to taxpayers who have failed to provide all forms of income on their return and will need to submit additional proof to avoid the IRS looking further into the situation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Identity theft has caused your tax return to be rejected.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS will notify a taxpayer if they believe that there may be fraudulent activity occurring on their tax return. The IRS will send a letter to you inquiring about a suspicious tax return that you may have not filed. The IRS will request that you do not e-file your return because of the duplicate social security number that was used. Act quickly should you receive this letter from the IRS to avoid further fraudulent activity with your personal information.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you need tax help, contact us for a free consultation.<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>affordable Tax Relief provides assistance to individuals struggling with unmanageable IRS tax burdens.

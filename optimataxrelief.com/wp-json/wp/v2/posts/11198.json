However, for individuals who owe back taxes, the path to homeownership can seem uncertain. It&#8217;s essential to understand the implications and challenges associated with buying a house while having outstanding tax debt. In this article, we will explore the factors to consider and strategies to help you navigate this unique situation.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Understanding Back Taxes<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Before diving into the home buying process, it&#8217;s crucial to understand what back taxes are. Back taxes are unpaid taxes from previous years, either due to underpayment or non-payment. The IRS may assess <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/marriage-bonuses-vs-marriage-penalties\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">penalties<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, interest, and other charges on the outstanding amount, which can accumulate over time. While it\u2019s not impossible to buy a house while having a tax balance, owing back taxes can potentially hurt your ability to qualify for a mortgage.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Addressing Back Taxes<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Addressing your back taxes is crucial before attempting to buy a house, especially since most lenders will not want to approve you for a mortgage if you haven\u2019t made any attempt to resolve your tax debt. This is because if you owe back taxes and own a home, the IRS can place a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/ask-phil-liens\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">tax lien<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> on your property<\/span>. A tax lien <span data-contrast=\"auto\">gives them first dibs at the home if you do not pay your back taxes. In other words, your lender would incur a major financial loss. Here are a few steps to help you address your tax debt:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Evaluate your options<\/span><\/b>.<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> The IRS may offer options for resolving back taxes, such as installment agreements, offers in compromise, or currently not collectible status. Consult a tax professional to determine the best course of action for your situation.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Establish a payment plan<\/span><\/b>.<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> If you can&#8217;t pay the entire amount upfront, consider setting up a payment plan with the IRS. This allows you to make monthly payments towards your tax debt over an extended period. Demonstrating a consistent repayment history will show lenders your commitment to resolving your financial obligations.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Consider professional help<\/span><\/b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. If your tax debt is complex or substantial, seek the assistance of a tax professional. These professionals can negotiate with the IRS on your behalf and help you explore potential resolution options.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Prioritize tax debt repayment<\/span><\/b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. Make it a priority to pay down your tax debt as much as possible. Dedicate a portion of your budget to regular payments, aiming to reduce your overall tax liability over time.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Qualifying for a Mortgage While Owing Back Taxes<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Once you&#8217;ve made significant progress in addressing your back taxes, you can focus on qualifying for a mortgage. Here are a few considerations:<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><em>Credit Score and History<\/em><\/span><\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Your credit score plays a crucial role in the mortgage application process. Maintaining a good credit score and demonstrating responsible financial behavior will enhance your chances of securing a mortgage.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><em>Debt-to-Income Ratio<\/em><\/span><\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Lenders assess your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) to evaluate your ability to manage mortgage payments. This ratio compares your total monthly debt payments to your gross monthly income. If you&#8217;re making payments on an IRS installment agreement, these payments will be factored into your DTI. A high DTI ratio could hurt your chances of getting approved for a mortgage, as it indicates you may struggle to manage additional debt. Paying down your tax debt and minimizing other outstanding debts can improve your DTI ratio and increase your chances of mortgage approval.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><em>Documentation<\/em><\/span><\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Prepare thorough documentation of your financial situation<\/span>. Be sure to<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> include proof of income, tax returns, and documentation related to your tax debt repayment. This documentation will help demonstrate your financial stability and responsible approach to resolving your tax obligations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Outstanding IRS Tax Liens<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If the IRS has placed a tax lien on your assets, it becomes a public record and signals to creditors that you have unpaid debts. Most lenders will require you to resolve the lien before approving a mortgage. You can do this either by paying off the debt or negotiating a payment plan with the IRS. If the IRS has placed a lien on your property, you may be able to request a Certificate of Discharge via IRS Form 14135. While this does not make the lien go away, it does offer a promise that the IRS will be paid once the assets are sold. This scenario is common when taxpayers are attempting to sell their home with a <a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/blog\/what-is-a-federal-tax-lien\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tax lien<\/a> attached to it, to purchase another home. Unless the lien is taken care of, mortgage lenders are unlikely to move forward.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Alternatives to Conventional Mortgages<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Qualifying for a mortgage while owing back taxes can depend on the type of loan you are seeking. For example, FHA loans are more desired for buyers because they allow you to buy a home with looser financial requirements. If you are seeking an FHA loan but owe back taxes, you must have made at least three&nbsp;payments to an IRS installment agreement, and meet other conditions, to be approved. &nbsp;In addition, some private or non-bank lenders may be willing to work with borrowers who have tax debt, but they often charge higher interest rates and may require larger down payments.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Owing State Taxes<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Owing <a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/blog\/live-work-pay-taxes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">state taxes<\/a> can also affect your ability to buy a home, though the specifics vary by state. Like federal back taxes, state tax agencies may place liens on your property for unpaid state taxes, which could complicate your mortgage approval process. Lenders are typically wary of any outstanding liens, whether federal or state, as these liens take priority over the mortgage in case of default. Some states also report unpaid taxes to credit bureaus, which can negatively impact your credit score. To improve your chances of securing a mortgage, it&#8217;s advisable to enter into a payment plan with the state tax authority, similar to an IRS installment agreement.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Getting Approved for a Mortgage While Owing Back Taxes<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you do manage to get a lender to approve you for a mortgage while owing back taxes, you should expect your tax bill to have an effect on your monthly payments. Because you will be considered a high-risk borrower, your interest rate will likely be higher than that of a low-risk borrower. You may also be required to put down a much larger down payment if the lender feels this might mitigate the risk that you come with. It goes without saying that these terms are not favorable for buyers, and seeking tax help from a professional can help lower the cost and stress associated with buying a home. affordable Tax Relief is the nation\u2019s leading tax resolution firm with over a decade of experience helping taxpayers with tough tax situations.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Contact Us Today for a <\/span><\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/app.affordabletaxrelief.com\/tax-problems\/?t=99&amp;utm_source=otr-blog-post&amp;utm_campaign=blog-cta&amp;adgroup=free-consultation&amp;network=otr-blogl&amp;ad=06-20-2023\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Free Consultation<\/span><\/b><\/a><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Buying a house is an exciting milestone in life, representing stability, investment, and the fulfillment of a dream.

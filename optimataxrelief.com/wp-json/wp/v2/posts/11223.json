It might look like a day at the racetrack, a quick stop at the gas station for a lottery ticket, or a weekend in Las Vegas. The IRS views all these activities as gambling, among many others. More importantly, the IRS wants everyone to know that all gambling winnings are considered taxable income. In this article, we\u2019ll break down how gambling winnings are taxed, how to handle taxes if you gamble professionally, and how to deal with gambling losses.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Gambling Winnings are Taxable<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Any winnings you receive from gambling, whether small or large, are considered taxable income and must be reported to the IRS. This is true whether the payer reports the winnings or not. If the payer does report your winnings to the IRS, they will do it through Form W-2G, Certain Gambling Winnings if:<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Winnings (not reduced by the wager) are $1,200 or more from bingo or a slot machine<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Winnings (reduced by the wager) are $1,500 or more from a keno game<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Winnings (reduced by the buy-in) exceed $5,000 from a poker game<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Winnings (except for bingo, slot machines, keno, or poker) reduced by the wager are $600 or more, or at least 300 times the wager<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Winnings are subject to federal income tax withholding<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">It should also be noted that other gambling winnings not reported are also taxable.

What makes this different from reporting your winnings on Form 1040? The main difference is that those who gamble for a living can deduct your costs of doing business using Schedule C to reduce your taxable income. This includes:<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The cost of magazines, periodicals, or other data you use in relation to your gambling<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Some of your internet expenses if you place bets online<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Meals and travel expenses for tournaments<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">It does not include deducting your losses that exceed your winnings. On top of that, you will need to pay self-employment tax on your winnings. If you gamble professionally, be sure to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/how-to-keep-good-tax-records\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">keep good tax records<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> for an easier filing process later.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Deducting Gambling Losses<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">You can deduct gambling losses as long as they do not exceed your winnings. However, in order to do this, you will need to itemize your deductions. That said, it\u2019s not beneficial to try to deduct your losses if itemizing your deductions will yield a larger tax liability than taking the standard deduction. For example, if you won $1,000 while gambling but lost $3,000, you may only deduct $1,000 when itemizing. You will need to claim $1,000 in income on your Form 1040 and then deduct $1,000 when you itemize using Schedule A. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What if I don\u2019t report my gambling winnings?<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Failure to report gambling winnings or attempting to evade taxes can have serious consequences.

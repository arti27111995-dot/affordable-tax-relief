The Initiative has been expanded since then, but still holds true to its original purpose. How exactly will it affect you if you\u2019re struggling to pay taxes? Here are the four components that Fresh Start Program has changed for your benefit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is the IRS Fresh Start Program?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS Fresh Start Program is a tax relief program that is designed to allow taxpayers to pay off substantial tax debts affordably over time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in the bad old days, the image of the IRS was one of intimidation. Whether deliberately cultivated or not, the IRS did little to dispel this perception. In recent years, the IRS has sought to reboot the way it interacts with taxpayers, with agents receiving training and instruction in how to assist taxpayers who are in arrears rather than torment them. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.optimataxrelief.com\/irs-fresh-start-initiative-to-allow-more-consumers-to-settle-tax-debt\/\">IRS Fresh Start program<\/a> combines penalty relief, installment payments; lien releases and a program known as Offer in Compromise that allows some taxpayers to settle their federal tax debts for less than what they actually owe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How the IRS Fresh Start Program help waive Tax penalties<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Originally, when paying and filing your taxes, missing the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.optimataxrelief.com\/irs-declares-tax-deadline-will-remain-on-july-15-blog\/\"> tax filing deadline<\/a> meant immediate interest charges and penalties. But with the Fresh Start Initiative, qualifying unemployed taxpayers can apply to have Failure-to-Pay penalties waived for six months. This means that individuals have until October 15th, 2020 to pay their 2019 taxes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How do you qualify for the IRS Fresh Start Program?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">To qualify for the Fresh Start Program, you must:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<li>Have been unemployed or seen a decrease in income<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Earn less than $100,000 a year individually\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Earn less than $200,000 a year as a couple\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Not have a large tax balance from the previous tax year\n<\/li>\n<\/&#038;nbsp>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS Fresh Start Tax Relief program was launched in 2012 to help taxpayers who were struggling from the effects of the ongoing financial crisis. The first aspect of the program provided some unemployed taxpayers with exemption from the failure-to-pay penalty. Under this initial slice of the Fresh Start Initiative, taxpayers received a six-month reprieve from penalties on taxes owed for their 2011 federal tax returns. Although interest was still applied to any unpaid taxes, penalties were suspended from April 17 to October 15, 2012.<\/p>\n<h2>Easy Installment Agreements<\/h2>\n<p><b><\/b>The IRS Fresh Start Program also raised the maximum tax owed for taxpayers from $25,000 to $50,000 to qualify for streamlined repayment plans. Under the streamlined installment payment agreement program, taxpayers may establish payment plans online through the Online Payment Agreement page located on the IRS website. Taxpayers who owe more than $50,000 may still establish installment agreements but must either file a Collection Information Statement (Form 433-A or Form 433-F) or make sufficient payments against their past-due tax balance to bring the total tax owed below the $50,000 threshold.<\/p>\n<h2>How To Withdraw Notice Of Federal Tax Lien<\/h2>\n<p>The Fresh Start Initiative raises the minimum threshold for filing an IRS Notice of Federal Tax Lien on taxes owed from $5,000 to $10,000. The new standard is not retroactive, and the IRS may still impose liens against taxpayers who owe less than $10,000 when the agency deems that circumstances warrant doing so. To request that the IRS withdraw the Notice of Federal Tax Lien against liens that have been released, taxpayers must file Form 12777 \u2013 Application for Withdrawal, available on the IRS website. When citing a reason for the request, taxpayers should check the last box which states \u201cthe taxpayer, or the Taxpayer Advocate acting on behalf of the taxpayer, believes withdrawal is in the best interest of the taxpayer and the government.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>How To Make use of &#8216;Offer in Compromise&#8217; and settle for less Tax<\/h2>\n<p>An<strong> Offer in Compromise<\/strong>, according to the IRS Fresh Start Program allows taxpayers to settle their obligations to the IRS for less than the total amount owed. The IRS only allows taxpayers to obtain relief under the Offer in Compromise program in circumstances where requiring repaying the full back taxes owed would constitute an undue burden or in cases where taxpayers demonstrate that they will be unlikely ever to be able to pay the full amount owed. Traditionally, the IRS has been stingy about accepting Offer in Compromise proposals from taxpayers; as a result, very few taxpayers were able to qualify for the program.<\/p>\n<p>The IRS Fresh Start Initiative has established more flexible standards in evaluating the financial standpoint of taxpayers who request relief under an Offer in Compromise. As a result, more taxpayers may qualify. To be eligible for this IRS tax relief program under the Offer in Compromise program for grounds other than Doubt as to Liability, taxpayers must meet all of the following conditions.<\/p>\n<h3>Requirements to qualify for the Offer In Compromise program:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Cannot have an open personal or business bankruptcy petition<\/li>\n<li>All required tax forms must have been filed<\/li>\n<li>All required tax payments for the current year must be paid<\/li>\n<li>Business owners with employees must have made current quarterly tax payments<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>An Offer in Compromise may be either for a single lump-sum payment or for installment payments. To request an Offer in Compromise, taxpayers must submit Form 433-A (OIC) for individuals or Form 433-B (OIC) for businesses along with either $205 to cover the application fee and either a payment of 20 percent of the proposed lump-sum payment or an amount equal to the first proposed monthly installment payment. Individuals and sole proprietors who qualify under Low Income Certification guidelines set by the IRS are exempted from paying the application fee.<\/p>\n<h2>New Installment Guidelines according to Fresh Start Program<\/h2>\n<p>Installment agreements allow a person to make monthly payments on their tax debt if they can\u2019t afford to pay the total at once, and\/or&nbsp;aren&#8217;t&nbsp;eligible for an Offer in Compromise. In the past, once an individual\u2019s tax balance reached $25,000, the IRS began conducting a financial analysis of the person\u2019s income and expenses to determine how much the taxpayer would pay per month. Additionally, a Notice of Federal Tax Liens was filed.<\/p>\n<p>Under Fresh Start, more taxpayers will be able to avoid this invasive process altogether, as the tax balance threshold has been raised to $50,000. At that point, once the installment agreement process is started, you\u2019ll now have six years to pay the debt off. If you are considering entering an installment agreement, let us know and we\u2019ll make sure you qualify.<\/p>\n<h2>Notice of Federal Tax Liens and the Fresh Start Program<\/h2>\n<p>If an individual fails to pay their tax debt the government can file a claim against that person\u2019s property with a federal tax lien. \u201cProperty\u201d includes everything an individual owns, including real estate, vehicles and financial assets. The Notice of Federal Tax Lien alerts creditors that the government has a legal right to a taxpayer\u2019s property. This may limit your ability to get credit.<\/p>\n<p>Similar to installment agreements, FSI has raised the Notice of Federal Tax Lien filing threshold to $10,000 from $5,000. The IRS might still choose to file at an amount less than $10,000, but it\u2019s not as automatic as before.<\/p>\n<h2>How the IRS Fresh Start Program can help with your Tax problems<\/h2>\n<p>While none of these alternatives represents an easy tax solution, each of them does provide a viable avenue for tax relief. If you have been struggling to pay your federal income tax burden, investigating possible assistance under the IRS Fresh Start Tax Relief program is definitely worth your while, either on your own or with the assistance of a tax professional. You may find that your overall tax burden is significantly reduced.<\/p>\n<h2>Wondering if you\u2019re eligible for the Fresh Start program? Give us a call.<\/h2>\n<p>Do you need tax relief help?

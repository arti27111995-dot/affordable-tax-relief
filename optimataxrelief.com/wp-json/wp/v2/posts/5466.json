Some look forward to a large refund; for others, it&#8217;s one more thing to tack onto their to-do list. For the scammers out there, it means the annual opportunity to rake in fraudulent refunds has finally arrived. Tax scammers are ruthless. They&#8217;re unaffected by the thought of families and individuals dependent upon what is likely their biggest check of the year being denied this financial relief.<\/p>\n<p>If there&#8217;s one thing we can be sure of, it&#8217;s that there&nbsp;<em>will&nbsp;<\/em>be scams this tax season. Fortunately, there are safeguards you can take to stay protected this tax season.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Schedule time with your tax preparer now&nbsp;<\/strong>so you can get your taxes done as early as possible. This will help decrease the chances that a fraudster will get your refund before you do.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sign up for Scam Alerts from the FTC&nbsp;<\/strong>to stay abreast of all the dirty tricks scammers are currently using.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Talk to someone in your HR department&nbsp;<\/strong>to see if you can get your W-2 before it&#8217;s mailed out. This will help ensure that you actually receive it so you don&#8217;t have to risk it being lost or stolen in the mail.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Never send emails with personally identifiable information (PII) attached.&nbsp;<\/strong>It&#8217;s best to never send them through email at all, but if you must, you should encrypt your message by making a change in your email&#8217;s security settings.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Beware of computer scams.&nbsp;<\/strong>These can come via email or as popups on your computer asking for your personal information. The IRS saw an approximate 400% surge in phishing and malware incidents in the 2016 tax season.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Always use a professional, trustworthy tax preparer.&nbsp;<\/strong>Sometimes, even national tax preparation chains can scam you out of your money or use less-than-secure procedures when it comes to handling your personal information. Make sure you use someone you trust.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Never provide any personal information over the phone&nbsp;<\/strong>to someone who says they are from the IRS. The IRS will&nbsp;<em>never&nbsp;<\/em>contact you via phone, email or social media.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Tax season is stress enough as it is; worrying about tax fraud shouldn&#8217;t have to be a part of it.

Learn how to spot a scam and what to do. Thousands of people fall victim to tax relief scams every year &#8211; make sure it\u2019s not you.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the Tax Relief Industry attracts circling vultures waiting to prey on those who are weakened by the threat of IRS action. You\u2019ve probably seen the ads. You\u2019ve heard the commercials. \u201cSettle your tax debt for pennies on the dollar,\u201d they claim. \u201cWe are the country\u2019s largest tax resolution firm,\u201d they explain. \u201cWe are a publicly traded corporation,\u201d they proclaim. Well Enron was a very large publicly traded company as well, and they weren\u2019t exactly trustworthy, were they? Some of these same firms have been sued by Attorney Generals for consumer fraud and theft. Others have over 1,000 complaints with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) for their tax resolution scams.<\/p>\n<p>Arm yourself with the tools necessary to defend against fraudulent companies and their self-serving actions. Start by informing yourself about some of the most common tax relief scams below and learn how to protect yourself.<\/p>\n<h2>Top Tax Relief Scams<\/h2>\n<h3>Tax Relief Scam #1 \u2013 Non-Refundable Upfront Payments Without Any Guarantees<\/h3>\n<p>The most common tax relief scam performed by these companies is to charge money upfront while promising to get results that they know are unpredictable, if not impossible, to achieve. The company may ask you to commit a very large sum of money upfront before an investigation is conducted or before the IRS side of the story is pulled (through the Master Transcript). These are the companies that are the sour apples in the industry because they are focused more on driving upfront revenue than actually helping their clients.<\/p>\n<h3>Tax Relief Scam #2 \u2013 Misrepresenting Potential Outcomes<\/h3>\n<p>Another common scam comes from aggressive salespeople who try to reel in clients by dangling anecdotal stories of \u2018pennies on the dollar\u2019 Offer in Compromise tax settlements. The reality is that very few taxpayers qualify for an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.affordabletaxrelief.com\/services\/tax-negotiation\/\">Offer in Compromise<\/a> (about 25% to 33% of applicants).<\/p>\n<p>But the scam companies out there won\u2019t tell you that. They may string you along and make you think you are being taken care of only to discover that, when all is said and done, you did not <a href=\"https:\/\/www.affordabletaxrelief.com\/services\/tax-negotiation\/offer-in-compromise\/\">qualify for the Offer in Compromise<\/a>. At which point the tax settlement scam company will conveniently assert that it was because the IRS did not approve it, and it was not their (the company\u2019s) fault.<\/p>\n<p>There are multiple factors the IRS considers in an Offer in Compromise application such as the taxpayer\u2019s ability to pay, income, expenses, and asset equity. The truth is that most taxpayers don&#8217;t qualify.<\/p>\n<p>When you are dealing with a new tax resolution company, ask yourself, does the company make a thorough assessment of the factors above? Do they emphasize the importance of these qualifications? Do they make it clear that an Offer in Compromise is difficult to obtain? If the answer to any of these questions is no, you may be dealing with a company who does not have your best interests in mind.<\/p>\n<h3>Tax Relief Scam #3 \u2013 Marketing Companies Posing as Service Providers<\/h3>\n<p>There are a lot of companies that advertise tax relief services but do nothing more than sell the customer\u2019s information to other service providers.<\/p>\n<p>A consumer is led to believe they are working directly with the company that&#8217;s doing the marketing, but in actuality their information will be sold to other service providers or outsourced independent contractors. The companies doing the marketing have no control over the quality of the product or the service levels given. In the worst cases, they sign up a consumer, with no intention of servicing the client whatsoever.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ewa-rteLine\">Information to protect against data brokers are:<\/div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"ewa-rteLine\">Social Security number<\/li>\n<li class=\"ewa-rteLine\">First &amp; Last Name<\/li>\n<li class=\"ewa-rteLine\">Date of Birth<\/li>\n<li class=\"ewa-rteLine\">Prior Year Annual Gross Income (AGI)<\/li>\n<li class=\"ewa-rteLine\">Driver\u2019s License Number<\/li>\n<li class=\"ewa-rteLine\">Current City, Address, Territory, and Zip code<\/li>\n<li class=\"ewa-rteLine\">Electronic Filing PIN<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Tax Relief Scam #4 \u2013 The Outright Fraudsters<\/h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, there are some firms who have outright cheated and stolen from their clients. These are the firms that are being targeted and shut down by the Attorney Generals and who have tarnished the industry.\u00a0 In these cases, the unscrupulous companies will enroll many clients into a program and collect their money without providing adequate services. Some don&#8217;t even send the necessary paperwork to the IRS.<\/p>\n<p>As soon as there are too many complaints or upset consumers, the company will simply change their name and start preying on consumers all over again. Adding insult to injury, many of these companies don\u2019t provide refunds and leave people even further in debt.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>Tax Relief Scam Companies Charged for Fraud in Recent Years<\/h2>\n<h3>Tax Master\u2019s<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-538 alignleft\" style=\"margin: 10px;\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/TaxMasters-Small-logo-100x60_full.png\" alt=\"TaxMasters-Tax Relief Scams\" width=\"135\" height=\"69\" \/>On March 30, 2012, Tax Master\u2019s was ordered along with its founder, Patrick Cox, to pay <a href=\"https:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2012\/03\/30\/news\/companies\/taxmasters-fraud\/index.htm\">$195 million<\/a> on charges that it\u00a0defrauded customers nationwide. A few weeks prior, the tax relief firm filed for\u00a0bankruptcy \u201cin an apparent effort to avoid\u00a0the state\u2019s enforcement action,\u201d explained the Texas Attorney general.<\/p>\n<p>Tax Master\u2019s unlawfully misled customers about their service contract terms, failed to disclose its no-refunds policy, and falsely claimed that the firm\u2019s employees would immediately begin work on a case \u2013 despite the fact that Tax Master\u2019s did not actually start to work on a case until its customers paid in full for services, even if that delayed response meant taxpayers missed significant IRS deadlines.<\/p>\n<h3>Roni \u201cTax Lady\u201d Deutch<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-539\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/ronideuch.png\" alt=\"ronideuch Tax Relief Scams\" width=\"192\" height=\"56\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In August 2010, former tax attorney Roni Deutch was hit with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/archives\/la-xpm-2010-aug-23-la-fi-tax-lady-20100823-story.html\">$34 million lawsuit<\/a> for allegedly defrauding thousands\u00a0of customers seeking tax advice. Then California Attorney General Jerry\u00a0Brown (now Governor of California) accused\u00a0her of airing misleading\u00a0advertisements about her services and engaging in\u00a0heavy-handed sales techniques to pressure clients. Included in the allegations were charges that Deutch&#8217;s firm not only did not provide the services promised to\u00a0clients but that she refused to refund fees.<\/p>\n<p>An order was issued in August of 2011 prohibiting Deutch from destroying any evidence related to the case. According to the current attorney general of California, Kamala D. Harris, however, Deutch began shredding documents immediately. The attorney general&#8217;s office alleges in its complaint that Deutch shredded nearly 2,000 pounds of the firm&#8217;s documents, or about 200,000 pages the day after the order was issued.<\/p>\n<h3>J.K.

In July 2007 a South Carolina judge approved a $6 million\u00a0settlement of a class-action lawsuit that had been brought against JK Harris by the Attorneys General of 18 states, including the AG of South Carolina, home to JK Harris&#8217; headquarters.<\/p>\n<p>The suit claimed that JK Harris &amp; Company was charging customers fees for resolving back tax\u00a0debts, but then failed to deliver on their promises, and engaged in deceptive marketing and advertising practices,\u00a0such as promoting that their regional offices were staffed by tax experts when they were often only sales representatives.<\/p>\n<h3>American Tax Relief<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-666\" style=\"margin: 10px;\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/tax-relief-scam.jpg\" alt=\"tax relief scam\" width=\"196\" height=\"59\" srcset=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/tax-relief-scam.jpg 545w, https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/tax-relief-scam-300x89.jpg 300w, https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/tax-relief-scam-540x163.jpg 540w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 196px) 100vw, 196px\" \/>The FTC filed charges against American Tax Relief in September 2010. The defendants\u00a0allegedly defrauded consumers out of a whopping $100 million during a short period of time in business! A summary judgement in favor of the FTC found that American Tax Relief falsely claimed they already had significantly reduced the tax debts of thousands of people and falsely told individual consumers they qualified for tax resolution programs that would significantly reduce their tax debts.<\/p>\n<p>In February 2013, the\u00a0defendants were found personally liable and\u00a0settled \u00a0the matter under an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission.\u00a0The settlement order imposes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/news-events\/press-releases\/2013\/02\/ftc-settlement-tax-relief-scammers-agree-pay-more-15-million\">a $103.3 million judgment against ATR, Hahn, and\u00a0Joo HyunPark<\/a>.<em>\u00a0<\/em> It also imposes judgments of $18 million and $595,000, respectively, against Young Soon Park and Il Kon Park, Joo Park\u2019s parents, who were found by the court to have received significant sums from the scheme&#8217;s earnings. The judgments will be suspended once the defendants and relief defendants have surrendered assets that total more than $15 million, including cash, a home in Beverly Hills and a condo in Los Angeles, jewelry and gold items and a 2005 Ferrari.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>How to Protect Yourself<\/h2>\n<h3>Do Your Research<\/h3>\n<p>Thankfully we now live in a world with Google and it\u2019s very easy to find out if a firm is one of the good guys or bad guys.\u00a0 To find out if the firm you are dealing with is trustworthy just look them up through the Better Business Bureau (BBB) or other similar sites.

The reputable firms in this industry will be paid their fees after they have rendered their services.\u00a0Some firms will include a nominal \u201cdiscovery fee\u201d for them to assign a tax professional to your case and do the research necessary to provide their recommended course of action.\u00a0 This is preferable to working with a firm that assesses all payments due upfront without knowing the specifics of your case.<\/p>\n<h3>What is your refund policy?<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re still considering working with a firm that is charging for their services upfront, you\u2019ll want to at least work with a firm that has a formal refund policy. If they are not able to deliver what they claim, you\u2019ll be able to get some or all of your money back.<\/p>\n<h3>Do you have any guarantees?<\/h3>\n<p>Ask them to put their money where their mouth is. A reputable firm will be willing to guarantee their performance.<\/p>\n<h3>Do you service your own clients?<\/h3>\n<p>Many firms are just marketing affiliates taking a cut for referring clients to larger backend companies. Ideally, you\u2019ll want to work with a company that services their own clients with an in-house team of CPA\u2019s and tax negotiators.<\/p>\n<p>Please don&#8217;t fall for any tax relief scams.

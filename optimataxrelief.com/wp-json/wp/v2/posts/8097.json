Under certain circumstances, a dependent can be claimed if they are not related to you. Once someone is identified as a dependent and placed on your tax return, you\u2019re essentially informing the IRS that you\u2019re financially responsible for that person.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For 2020, the dependent credit for other than qualifying children is $500. A credit is different from a deduction because the credit reduces any taxes that are owed while a deduction will reduce the amount of income that is subject to tax.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A partner can be claimed as a dependent if they meet the following criteria:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>No one else is able to claim your partner as a dependent child on their tax return.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The person that is being claimed must be a U.S. citizen, a U.S. national, a U.S. resident alien, or a resident of Canada or Mexico also might qualify.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Your partner must live with you year-round.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Your partner\u2019s gross income for the year cannot exceed $4,300 for 2020.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You will need to require half of your partner\u2019s financial support during the year.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Your partner cannot be married to someone else or file a joint return with that other person.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You and your partner must live together for the entirety of the year in order to qualify as a dependent. If you have moved in the middle of the year, you will be required to wait until the next year before claiming your partner as a dependent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve taken a vacation, or were deployed with the military, you will be considered living together. Based off IRS guidelines, the following types of absences will not count against you:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Illness, such as time spent in a hospital or rehabilitation facility<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Vacations<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Business travel or assignments<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Education-related absences<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Absences for military service<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>affordable Tax Relief provides assistance to individuals struggling with unmanageable IRS tax burdens.

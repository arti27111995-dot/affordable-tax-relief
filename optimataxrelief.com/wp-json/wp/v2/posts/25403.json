If you\u2019ve defaulted on your student loans, this could impact your paycheck and even your tax refund. With over 43 million Americans carrying student loan debt, this shift affects a huge portion of the population.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What You Should\u2019ve Received<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Borrowers should have received an official notice from Federal Student Aid (FSA), an office within the U.S. Department of Education, outlining the return of collection efforts. If you didn\u2019t see the email or letter, it\u2019s important to check your spam folder or log into your loan servicer\u2019s website for updates.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How the Government Can Collect<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once a loan is in default, the federal government has powerful tools to collect, without a court order. Through the Treasury Offset Program, your <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/did-the-irs-take-my-refund\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tax refund may be seized<\/a> and applied toward your outstanding student loan balance. Additionally, the government can garnish up to 15% of your disposable income straight from your paycheck.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What You Should Do Now<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve defaulted or are struggling to make student loan payments, don\u2019t wait. Contact your loan servicer and ask about available repayment options. Many borrowers qualify for income-driven repayment plans, rehabilitation programs, or other solutions that can help you avoid wage garnishment or refund offsets.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-phil-s-tip-nbsp\"><strong>Phil\u2019s Tip<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you also are dealing with unpaid taxes, Student Loans are one of the allowed expenses IRS will let you take when considering repayment or financial hardship options.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you need tax help, contact us today for a <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/app.optimataxrelief.com\/tax-problems\/?t=99&amp;utm_source=otr-blog-post&amp;utm_campaign=blog-cta&amp;adgroup=free-consultation&amp;network=otr-blogl&amp;ad=03-08-2024%22%20%EF%B7%9FHYPERLINK%20%22https:\/\/app.optimataxrelief.com\/tax-problems\/?t=99&amp;utm_source=otr-blog-post&amp;utm_campaign=blog-cta&amp;adgroup=free-consultation&amp;network=otr-blogl&amp;ad=06-06-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Free Consultation<\/strong><\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today, Optima Tax Relief\u2019s Chief Tax Officer and Lead Tax Attorney, Phil, discusses what\u2019s happening with student loan collections and what it means if you\u2019ve defaulted on yours.&nbsp; Yes, Student Loan Collections Are Back&nbsp; After years of pauses and extensions, federal student loan collections have officially resumed.

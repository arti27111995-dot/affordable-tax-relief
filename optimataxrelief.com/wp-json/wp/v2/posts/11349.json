GoFundMe has become a powerful platform for individuals and organizations to raise funds for various causes<\/span>. These<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> rang<\/span>e<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> from medical expenses and emergency relief to community projects and personal aspirations. However, many users of the platform<\/span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">often wonder about the tax implications of crowdfunding. Do you have to pay taxes on GoFundMe donations? Are GoFundMe donations tax-deductible? This article explores these questions, offering a comprehensive guide on the relationship between GoFundMe and taxes.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">How Does GoFundMe Work?<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Crowdfunding sites, like GoFundMe, provide a way for people to solicit donations from friends, family members, and even strangers who want to support their cause. First, you\u2019ll need to set up a campaign page with a title and description of your cause. You&#8217;ll also set a fundraising goal. Once your page is set up, you can share it with others through social media, email, and other channels using effective fundraising strategies. People who visit your campaign page can make donations directly through the GoFundMe platform. The platform allows them to utilize various services that facilitate secure transactions. They do this by using their credit or debit cards, and sometimes third-party payment apps, like PayPal. Once you start receiving donations, you can withdraw the funds from your campaign, less any fees that the site charges. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Are Donations Received Through GoFundMe Taxable?&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The big question everyone wants to know is \u201cAre donations received through GoFundMe taxed<\/span>?&#8221; <span data-contrast=\"auto\">Typically, donations are considered nontaxable gifts in the IRS\u2019s eyes. However, the intent behind the donations plays a crucial role<\/span>. T<span data-contrast=\"auto\">here are a couple of exceptions that can cause the IRS to consider your crowdfunded money taxable income.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Crowdfunded money is taxable if your donors received something in return for their donations<\/span><\/i><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you offer something of value in exchange for a donation, this transaction could instead be viewed as a sale. Since profits from sales are taxed as income, the IRS would view the \u201cdonation\u201d as taxable.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Crowdfunded money is taxable if an employer sets up the fund for their employee<\/span><\/i><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In this scenario, because the fund was set up by an employer, it is considered additional income<\/span>. This basically <span data-contrast=\"auto\">means it is taxed accordingly.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Crowdfunded money is taxable if someone organized the fund on behalf of someone else but does not give the funded money to them<\/span><\/i><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In this scenario, the fund would be considered taxable income and would be added to the organizer\u2019s gross income. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you<\/span>&#8216;<span data-contrast=\"auto\">re crowdfunding for a business venture, instead of a personal cause, t<\/span>axability<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> can become very complicated. In general, when a GoFundMe campaign is created to fund a business or profit-generating activity, the money received may be considered taxable income by the IRS. L<\/span>et&#8217;s say you set<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> up a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for a <a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/blog\/tax-checklist-for-starting-a-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">business startup<\/a><\/span>. T<span data-contrast=\"auto\">he funds may be subject to income tax as they can be seen as an investment or capital contribution.\u00a0Consulting a tax professional is your best option if you are attempting to crowdfund for a business venture.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Are GoFundMe Donations Tax-Deductible?<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What if you\u2019re on the other side of the screen and you are the one making the donations? One key thing to remember is the IRS does not allow you to deduct crowdfunded contributions during tax time. <\/span> If you&#8217;re donating to a friend, family member, or a cause that supports an individual\u2019s personal needs, you cannot claim a tax deduction for your contribution.&nbsp;That said, most GoFundMe pages do not qualify. Some GoFundMe campaigns are set up to benefit nonprofit organizations or charities. In these cases, donations may be tax-deductible if the organization is a registered 501(c)(3) organization. Before making a donation, it\u2019s crucial to verify whether the recipient organization has tax-exempt status under the IRS rules. GoFundMe offers an option to donate directly to verified charities. However, donors should always ensure they keep records of their contributions to claim any potential tax deduction.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Understanding Gift Taxes on GoFundMe Donations<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other tax obligations to keep in mind if you donate large sums of money through GoFundMe. That is the federal gift tax. The gift tax is a federal levy on gifts over a certain value. Gifts can include money, property, art, vehicles, and more. In 2025, the federal gift tax exclusion cap is $19,000. This means you can give a single person up to $19,000 without having to report it to the IRS.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you exceed the annual limit, you\u2019ll need to file a federal gift tax return via IRS Form 709. However, just because you file this return doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019ll owe taxes on the GoFundMe gift. You technically won\u2019t owe taxes until you\u2019ve exhausted the lifetime exemption amount, which is $13.99 million in 2025. If you finally exhaust the lifetime limit, you\u2019ll be subject to a <a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/blog\/ask-phil-how-do-gift-taxes-work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">gift tax<\/a> rate from 18% to 40%, depending on how much you gifted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Record-Keeping for <\/strong><strong>GoFundMe <\/strong><strong>Donors and Recipients&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Both GoFundMe donors and recipients should keep detailed records of their contributions and receipts to ensure compliance with tax regulations. Donors who contribute to a qualified 501(c)(3) charity through GoFundMe may be eligible for a tax deduction, but they must maintain proper documentation. This can GoFundMe receipts and proof of payment, such as bank or credit card statements. The IRS requires written acknowledgment from the charitable organization for donations of $250 or more, which may not always be automatically provided by GoFundMe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For recipients, record-keeping is essential in determining whether funds raised are considered gifts or taxable income. If the campaign is for personal use, such as covering medical expenses or disaster relief, the funds are generally considered gifts and are not taxable to the recipient. However, if the funds are given in exchange for services, goods, or business support, they may be treated as taxable income.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>1099-K Forms for GoFundMe Campaign Organizers<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, GoFundMe may issue IRS Form 1099-K to campaign organizers if total payments received exceed the 1099-K threshold in a calendar year, or if the threshold set by the recipient&#8217;s state is met. In 2025, this threshold is $5,000 over any number of transactions. While receiving a <a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/blog\/how-to-prepare-for-the-new-1099k-thresholds-in-2025\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1099-K<\/a> does not automatically mean the funds are taxable, it signals that the IRS has been notified of the payments, and proper classification of the funds is critical.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the complexities of tax laws surrounding crowdfunding, consulting with a tax professional is strongly recommended. A tax advisor can help donors determine deductibility, assist recipients in properly reporting funds, and provide guidance on potential state tax implications.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Tax Help for GoFundMe Users<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The important thing to keep in mind here is that there are responsibilities on both sides of the aisle, whether you are the organizer of a crowdfunding campaign or a donor. If you are the organizer, always make sure to use the platform responsibly and transparently. If you are a donor, stay below the annual gift tax limit as often as possible. When you can\u2019t, or when you finally exhaust the lifetime limit, make all the necessary tax filings and payments. Keeping accurate records, verifying the tax-exempt status of charitable organizations, and consulting with a tax professional are key steps in ensuring that both donors and recipients stay compliant with IRS regulations.&nbsp;Additionally, implementing Financial Protection and Cybersecurity Excellence strategies can further safeguard your crowdfunding activities.

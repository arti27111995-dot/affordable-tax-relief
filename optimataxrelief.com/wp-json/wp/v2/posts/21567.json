Each section includes deadlines, helpful tips, and ways to prepare.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tax Deadlines for Individuals<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re an individual filer, you may have several 2025 tax deadlines to note in your calendar. Here are important dates to keep in mind if you are a W-2 employee, independent contractor, self-employed individual, gig worker, or retiree. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>January 15, 2025 \u2013 Fourth Quarter Estimated Tax Payment<\/strong>: If you\u2019re self-employed or pay <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/estimated-quarterly-tax-payments-explained\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">estimated taxes<\/a> throughout the year, the fourth quarter estimated tax payment for 2024 is due on January 15, 2025.

Plan for potential delays in processing, especially if mailing physical copies. Use e-filing options to speed up submissions.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>February 18, 2025 \u2013 Updated W-4 Forms Due:<\/strong> If you claimed exemption from withholding in 2024, you\u2019ll need to file an updated Form W-4 by February 15 to continue the exemption. This applies primarily to employees who believe they will not owe taxes or will get a refund.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>April 1, 2025 \u2013 Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) Due:<\/strong> If you turned 73 in 2024, April 1, 2025, is the deadline to take your first Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) from retirement accounts like traditional IRAs and 401(k)s.

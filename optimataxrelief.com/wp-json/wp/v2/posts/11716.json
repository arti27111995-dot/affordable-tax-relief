Your returns were less vulnerable to calculation errors and you received your tax refund much quicker than you did filing paper returns. But this year, when you attempted to e-file your federal income tax return, the IRS rejected your submission, issuing a statement that a previously filed return using your Social Security number was already on file. How could such a thing happen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Welcome to the world of identity theft, tax fraud style. Scammers filing falsified returns reap millions for their fraudulent efforts, spending the money from their ill-gotten gains long before the IRS \u2013 or their victims \u2013 become privy to the fact that a crime has even been committed. Many victims only learn that they\u2019ve been targeted after receiving an audit notice from the IRS. In the meantime, fines, fees, penalties and interest from tax return fraud have accumulated, \u2013 and it\u2019s largely up to victims to straighten out the mess.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How tax fraud victims are targeted<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phone and Email Scams<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most obvious way to protect yourself against scammers is to never give out your personal information to someone you don\u2019t know, especially over the phone. If someone from the \u201cIRS\u201d is attempting to contact you over the phone or by email and asks for your social security or card information, don\u2019t give it to them. The IRS almost never contacts via phone, instead preferring to send notices via mail. Even if you do receive a call from the IRS, they won\u2019t ask for your social security number \u2013 they already have that information.\u00a0 The IRS will never leave you threatening voicemails about any possible tax balance or fraud regarding your account and will never ask for you to provide personal information or payments over the phone.\u00a0If you feel uncomfortable about the validity of a call, hang up and call the IRS yourself \u2013 that way you know if what they\u2019re telling you is true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Accountant fraud<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be wary of scammers who will pose as a tax preparer and then rip off customers through refund fraud or identity theft. These phony accountants will tell you that they can get you a large tax refund and typically prey on low-income and non-English speaking taxpayers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you go to a legitimate tax preparer, your information can still be exposed if there is a data breach. To avoid this happening \u2013 and being left vulnerable \u2013 ask your tax preparer what more you can do to protect your information in case of a breach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Identity theft<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure to protect your social security number at all costs. Identity thieves will attempt to steal this information in order to steal not only your identity but your tax refund too. As long as you notify the IRS that your information has been compromised and your refund has been stolen, the IRS will work with you to provide your refund. However, it will take extensive time and paperwork to prove that your information was stolen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medical Identity theft<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Financial fraud such as a stolen credit card can be frustrating but can be quickly resolved since it\u2019s easier to detect, and often doesn\u2019t have significant long-term financial impacts. Medical identity fraud, on the other hand, can cost a victim tens of thousands of dollars and be notoriously difficult to resolve. Because of advancements in electronic communication and collaboration in the healthcare industry, personal health information (PHI) is more exposed and accessible. At the same time, this doesn\u2019t always mean that your health provider is on the same page with your insurer. PHI is rarely tracked across multiple networks and this gap can make stealing and using it feasible.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Protecting Yourself from Tax Return Fraud<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to protect yourself from tax return fraud is by limiting access to your Social Security number. A bit of vigilance will protect you from many fraudulent attempts to obtain your Social Security number. Don\u2019t carry your Social Security card unless you need to provide a copy for a job application or a similar purpose. Protect sensitive information on your computer by maintaining up-to-date antivirus and antispyware software and firewalls. <strong>Never send emails with personally identifiable information (PII) attached.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think twice before responding to unsolicited \u201cpre-approved credit\u201d offers received online or in the mail. Never supply sensitive personal or financial information unless you have initiated the transaction or conversation \u2013 or unless you are 110 percent sure that the person on the phone or the website you\u2019re dealing with is the real deal. If you receive questionable communication requesting (or demanding) sensitive financial or personal information from a company you\u2019ve done business with, contact the company directly to verify that it is indeed them requesting the information.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you receive unsolicited email, social media or text messages claiming to be from the IRS, there is a 100 percent probability that they\u2019re fake. The IRS only initiates communications with taxpayers by regular mail or by telephone &#8211; <\/span><b>period<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Do not respond directly to such communications in any way. Instead, report suspicious IRS-related communications to phishing@irs.gov or call 1-800-366-4484. You can also s<\/span>ign up for Scam Alerts from the FTC to stay abreast of all the dirty tricks scammers are currently using.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>If You\u2019ve Been Victimized by Tax Return Fraud<\/strong><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright wp-image-4560\" src=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/tax_fraud.jpg\" alt=\"tax_fraud\" width=\"314\" height=\"222\" \/><\/h2>\n<p>The first indication that you\u2019ve been victimized by tax return fraud often comes in the form of an inquiry from the IRS about discrepancies in your return. You may be questioned about returns issued in your name which you never received or wages earned for companies you\u2019ve never even heard of. You may also be assessed additional taxes or tax return offsets for years that you didn\u2019t file a tax return at all. Another telltale sign is a notice from the IRS that multiple returns have been filed during a single year using your Social Security number.<\/p>\n<p>Once you become aware that you\u2019ve been targeted by tax return fraud, you must act quickly to limit the damage. File a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission and a police report with your local law enforcement agency. Contact one or more of the three major credit reporting bureaus (TransUnion, Equifax or Experian) to have a fraud alert placed on your credit report. Close any credit card or other accounts that have been compromised or opened without your knowledge. Also, check your earnings report annually with the Social Security Administration to endure that there is no fraudulent activity.<\/p>\n<p>If your federal tax refund has been stolen or you have other unresolved tax-fraud related issues, contact the IRS Identity Protection Specialized Unit at (800)908-4490. You can protect yourself from further tax return fraud attempts by filing \u201cForm 14039 \u2013 Identity Theft Affidavit\u201d with the IRS. It\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll be required to file a paper return for the present tax year and it may take months to resolve your case, as well as restore any refunds to which you\u2019re rightfully entitled.<\/p>\n<p>However, the IRS will issue you a unique IP PIN that will replace your Social Security number and which will allow you to e-file future federal income tax returns safely. Do not use this IP PIN for any other reason \u2013 including state income tax returns.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You\u2019ve always filed your income tax returns electronically in the past.

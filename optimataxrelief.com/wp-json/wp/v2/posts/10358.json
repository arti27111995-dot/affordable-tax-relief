Payments have been paused several times since the Cares Act passed in March 2020. However, it seems the pause may be extended again past the August 31<sup>st<\/sup> deadline. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Student Loan Forgiveness&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, President Biden may announce a decision on student loan forgiveness. There has been some speculation that Biden plans to cancel $10,000 for more than 40 million federal student borrowers. Included loans are the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP), Perkins Loans, Grad PLUS Loans, and Parent PLUS Loans, many of which have not been included in recent loan forgiveness initiatives. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Limited Waiver\u00a0<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A limited waiver was instituted in October 2021, allowing borrowers to count payments that were once considered ineligible toward forgiveness. Ineligible payments include late payments, partial payments and payments made under the incorrect payment plan. This one-time exception is due to expire after October 31, 2022. However, President Biden has named an extension of the waiver as another permanent means of loan forgiveness. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Republican Repayment Plan\u00a0<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Three Republican members of Congress introduced a new bill that serves as an alternative to President Biden\u2019s potential plan. The plan does not include any major loan cancellation. It seeks to end the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program set to begin in July 2023 and the payment pause. The bill also introduces a new Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan that would replace the current income-driven repayment plans. It would also eliminate capitalization of student loan interest. Finally, the bill would limits student loan interest to 10 years, which can save borrowers thousands of dollars. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tax Debt Relief for Student Borrowers&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While student loan forgiveness seems attractive to many, nothing is set in stone yet. That said, borrowers should continue to plan for repayment. Additionally, borrowers should remain mindful of available tax breaks and filing requirements.

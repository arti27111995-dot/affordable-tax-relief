One unique way to do this is by hiring your kids for work within your family business or household.

For children under 21, you are also exempt from paying Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) tax. If your business is a corporation, partnership with someone other than your child\u2019s parent, or an estate, you must also withhold FUTA taxes and FICA taxes. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-income-tax-considerations\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Income Tax Considerations<\/span><\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If your child earns more than the current standard deduction amount, they may need to file a tax return.

However, if their total income is below this threshold, they likely won&#8217;t owe any federal income tax. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-claiming-dependents\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Claiming Dependents<\/span><\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">You can still <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/dependents-and-your-taxes\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">claim your child as a dependent<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> on your own tax return as long as they rely on you for financial support, and you meet all other requirements. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-roth-ira-contributions\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Roth IRA Contributions<\/span><\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If your child earns income from working for your business, consider helping them open a Roth IRA.

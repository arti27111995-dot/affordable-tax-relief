A W-2 tax form shows important information about the income you\u2019ve earned from your employer, how much taxes were withheld from your paycheck, benefits provided and other details for the year. You file your federal and state taxes with this form. But what happens if you lose your W-2? If you lose your W-2 form, don\u2019t panic. Here are some options you have if you do not have your W-2 form when filing your taxes.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Contact Your Employer<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you lose your W-2, your first reaction should be to contact your employer to request a replacement. You will typically need to contact your Human Resources department to obtain a duplicate.&nbsp;This is also true if you are trying to obtain a W-2 for a previous year or for an employer you no longer work for. Employers are required to keep copies of W-2 forms for four years; however, some may keep them for longer. It&#8217;s important to be aware that some employers might charge you a fee for providing a copy of your W-2. You should contact your employer for a copy of your W-2 form if you did not receive one for the year at all. Employers are required by law to distribute W-2s by January 31<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">st<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> of each year. You should note that some employers distribute these forms electronically through email or an employee portal. If you haven\u2019t received one by early February, you might want to contact your employer. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Contact the IRS<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In some rare cases, your employer may not be able to help you obtain another copy of your W-2. In this case, you can contact the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/tops-risks-of-owing-the-irs\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">IRS<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> for help. During your phone call, you\u2019ll need to verify your identity by providing your name, address, phone number and Social Security number. You will also need to provide your employer\u2019s information and other employment information, including employment dates, estimate of wages and amount of federal taxes withheld last year.&nbsp;The IRS will reach out to your employer on your behalf and request your W-2 be sent to you. Note that the IRS will contact your employer about the current tax year\u2019s W-2. If you\u2019re looking for a previous tax year\u2019s W-2, you\u2019ll need to request a transcript copy from the IRS. The transcript will include federal tax information your employer reported. That said, it will not include any state or local tax information reported by your employer. Transcripts are available for up to 10 years. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Contact the Social Security Administration<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Since your employer reports your earnings to the Social Security Administration, you can request copies of your W-2s from them if you lose the original. You can request a copy for any W-2 from the years 1978 to the present, however it may cost you. You can get free copies if you need them for a Social Security-related purpose. There is&nbsp;a $126 fee per request for other purposes including:<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Federal or state tax filings<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Residency establishment<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Private pension entitlement<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Worker&#8217;s compensation income information<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you are seeking W-2s from multiple tax years, this option can quickly become expensive.

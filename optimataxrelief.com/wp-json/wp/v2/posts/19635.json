It&#8217;s designed to help offset the costs of raising children. Individuals with children under the age of 17 could potentially receive up to $2,000 per eligible dependent. $1,600 of that sum could be eligible for refund in the 2024 filing season.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Who Qualifies for the Child Tax Credit?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First, you\u2019ll need to determine the child\u2019s eligibility. The child must meet certain criteria such as:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> The child must be your son, daughter, stepchild, foster child, brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, half-brother, half-sister, or a descendant of any of them (such as your grandchild, niece, or nephew).\u00a0<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Age: <\/strong>The child must be under 17 years old at the end of the tax year for which you are claiming the credit.\u00a0<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Support:<\/strong> The child must not have provided more than half of their own support for the tax year.\u00a0<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dependent: <\/strong>You must claim the child as a dependent on your federal tax return.\u00a0<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Citizenship: <\/strong>The child must be a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, or U.S. resident alien.\u00a0<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Not File Joint Return:<\/strong> The child must not file a joint return with their spouse for the tax year. If they did, they must only file to claim a refund of withheld income tax or estimated tax paid.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also income limitations for the child tax credit. In 2023, eligibility for the child tax credit hinged on your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). Thresholds were set at $400,000 or less for married couples filing jointly, and $200,000 or less for other filers. However, if your MAGI surpassed these limits, the $2,000 credit was gradually reduced by $50 for every additional $1,000 over the threshold.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re unsure about your eligibility for the child tax credit, consider asking for help from a tax professional. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you need tax help, contact us today for a <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/app.optimataxrelief.com\/tax-problems\/?t=99&amp;utm_source=otr-blog-post&amp;utm_campaign=blog-cta&amp;adgroup=free-consultation&amp;network=otr-blogl&amp;ad=05-17-2024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Free Consultation<\/strong><\/a><strong>.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today, Affordable Tax Relief Lead Tax Attorney, Phil, talks about the Child Tax Credit, breaking down what it is and who qualifies.\u00a0 What is the Child Tax Credit?&nbsp; The child tax credit is a tax benefit provided by the IRS to parents or guardians who have dependent children.

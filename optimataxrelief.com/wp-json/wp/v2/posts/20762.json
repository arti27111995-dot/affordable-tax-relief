If you\u2019re self-employed, be sure to use Form 1040-ES to make <a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/estimated-quarterly-tax-payments-explained\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">estimated tax payments<\/a> quarterly to cover your income tax and self-employment tax obligations. Mark the quarterly tax payments on your calendar to avoid penalties and interest: April 15, June 15, September 15, and January 15 of the following year.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pay Your Tax Bill in Full When Due<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoid penalties and interest by paying your entire tax bill by the due date, typically April 15 for individual income tax returns. Use direct payment from your bank account via IRS Direct Pay, debit or credit card payments, or electronic funds withdrawal when e-filing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Request an Installment Agreement<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can\u2019t pay your tax bill in full, request an <a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/how-irs-installment-agreements-work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">installment agreement<\/a> from the IRS by applying online using the IRS Online Payment Agreement tool or by submitting Form 9465, Installment Agreement Request. Depending on your financial situation, you can negotiate monthly payments over a period of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Apply for Hardship Programs<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re experiencing financial hardship, consider options like an Offer in Compromise (OIC), which allows you to settle your tax debt for less than the full amount owed. Be sure to provide detailed financial information to demonstrate inability to pay or prove that paying would create significant economic hardship.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you need tax help, contact us today for a <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/app.affordabletaxrelief.com\/tax-problems\/?t=99&amp;utm_source=otr-blog-post&amp;utm_campaign=blog-cta&amp;adgroup=free-consultation&amp;network=otr-blogl&amp;ad=03-08-2024%22%20%EF%B7%9FHYPERLINK%20%22https:\/\/app.affordabletaxrelief.com\/tax-problems\/?t=99&amp;utm_source=otr-blog-post&amp;utm_campaign=blog-cta&amp;adgroup=free-consultation&amp;network=otr-blogl&amp;ad=08-02-2024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Free Consultation<\/strong><\/a><strong>.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today, affordable Tax Relief Lead Tax Attorney, Phil, gives his insights on the best way to pay off tax debt.\u00a0 Withhold the Correct Amount&nbsp; Ensure your employer withholds the correct amount of federal income tax from your paycheck based on your Form W-4.

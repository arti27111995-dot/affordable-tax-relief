Enacted on December 18, 2015, the law made several temporary tax provisions permanent while extending others. One of its primary goals was to enhance tax compliance by implementing stricter regulations on tax credits and identification numbers. The PATH Act impacts individual taxpayers, businesses, and nonprofit organizations by modifying tax credits, extending certain deductions, and strengthening fraud prevention measures. Understanding the PATH Act is important for anyone filing taxes, particularly those claiming refundable credits or operating a small business.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Key Provisions of the PATH Act<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The PATH Act introduced a range of measures that impact individual taxpayers, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) Changes<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The PATH Act introduced stricter measures for refundable tax credits to curb fraud and identity theft. One major change requires the IRS to delay tax refunds for individuals claiming the <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/what-is-the-earned-income-tax-credit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)<\/a> or the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) until mid-February. This delay allows the IRS to verify income and prevent improper payments.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, before the PATH Act, fraudulent tax preparers could quickly file false returns with fabricated income to claim EITC refunds. By delaying these refunds, the IRS has additional time to match income data with employer-reported wages, significantly reducing improper refunds.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the law tightened eligibility rules. Taxpayers claiming the EITC or ACTC must provide a valid Social Security number (SSN) that is issued before the due date of the return. This prevents individuals from retroactively applying for these credits after obtaining an SSN.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>ITIN (Individual Taxpayer Identification Number) Changes<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The PATH Act introduced important changes regarding Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs), which are used by individuals who are not eligible for a Social Security number but still need to file taxes. Under the new rules, ITINs that were not used on a federal tax return for three consecutive years automatically expire. This change ensures that inactive ITINs are removed from circulation, preventing misuse.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, ITINs issued before 2013 must be renewed on a staggered schedule. Taxpayers with ITINs starting with specific digits were required to renew first, and the IRS has continued to enforce this rolling expiration policy. For instance, if a taxpayer had an ITIN issued in 2010 and had not used it since 2017, it would have expired under the PATH Act rules, requiring renewal before filing a tax return. These changes were implemented to strengthen the integrity of the tax system and reduce the risk of identity fraud involving ITINs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Bonus Depreciation and Small Business Incentives<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Businesses benefited significantly from the PATH Act, particularly through the extension of bonus depreciation and the expansion of <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/what-is-a-179-deduction\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Section 179 deductions<\/a>. Bonus depreciation allows businesses to deduct a larger portion of the cost of new equipment in the year of purchase, rather than spreading the deduction over several years. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Section 179 deduction allows businesses to immediately expense certain asset purchases. This is rather than depreciating them over time. Before the PATH Act, the deduction limit fluctuated, creating uncertainty for business owners. By permanently setting a higher limit, the Act provided stability, allowing businesses to plan long-term investments confidently.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a small manufacturing company investing in new machinery could now deduct a significant portion of the cost in the first year, reducing taxable income and freeing up capital for further expansion. This provision was particularly beneficial for small and medium-sized enterprises looking to modernize operations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Tax-Exempt Organizations and Charitable Contributions<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The PATH Act also included several provisions that benefited charitable organizations and donors. One key change made permanent the ability for taxpayers aged 70\u00bd or older to make tax-free distributions from their Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) directly to qualified charities. This provision is known as the <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/what-are-qualified-charitable-distributions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD)<\/a> rule. It allows retirees to satisfy their required minimum distributions (RMDs) while excluding the donated amount from taxable income.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, a retiree who does not need their full RMD amount to cover living expenses can donate up to $100,000 per year to a charity, reducing their taxable income while supporting a cause they care about. This provision provides an efficient way for high-net-worth retirees to engage in philanthropy while benefiting from tax advantages.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, the PATH Act made permanent the enhanced deduction for donations of food inventory by businesses. This encourages restaurants, grocery stores, and food manufacturers to donate surplus food to qualified organizations.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Impact on Taxpayers<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The PATH Act introduced several changes that directly affect taxpayers, ranging from refund delays to enhanced tax incentives. Understanding these changes can help taxpayers make informed financial decisions and plan for the tax season accordingly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How the PATH Act Affects Early Filers<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most noticeable effects of the PATH Act for individual taxpayers is the delay in refunds if they claim the EITC or ACTC. While this delay may be frustrating for those who rely on early refunds, it prevents tax fraud. The IRS uses this extra time to match employer-reported income data with taxpayer claims. This reduces the number of erroneous or fraudulent refunds.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a taxpayer who files their return on January 25 and claims the EITC may not receive their refund until mid-to-late February. This is even if the IRS accepts their return immediately. Understanding this delay can help taxpayers plan their finances accordingly and avoid dependency on an early refund for urgent expenses.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Benefits for Low- and Middle-Income Families<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The PATH Act\u2019s provisions primarily benefit working families by ensuring that tax credits remain available while reducing fraud that could undermine these programs. By requiring valid Social Security numbers and tightening compliance rules, the Act ensures that EITC and ACTC funds reach eligible households rather than fraudulent filers. Since fraudulent claims are reduced, the overall integrity of the tax credit system is strengthened.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Implications for Small Businesses and the Self-Employed<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/tax-checklist-for-starting-a-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">business owners<\/a> and self-employed individuals, the PATH Act provides certainty and incentives for growth. The permanent Section 179 deduction allows for predictable tax planning, encouraging businesses to invest in new equipment, technology, and improvements.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, let&#8217;s say a freelance photographer upgrades their camera equipment. They can immediately deduct the full cost under Section 179, reducing their taxable income for the year. Similarly, a restaurant investing in kitchen renovations benefits from the extended bonus depreciation rules, improving cash flow and business operations.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why the PATH Act Matters<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The PATH Act is essential because it strengthens anti-fraud measures. It reduces identity theft and improper tax credit claims, while also providing stability through permanent tax provisions. By enforcing stricter eligibility requirements for tax credits and ITINs, the law protects the integrity of the tax system. Additionally, by making key business incentives permanent, it allows companies to plan investments with confidence, fostering economic growth and stability. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tax Help in 2025<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The PATH Act has had a lasting impact on the tax system by strengthening anti-fraud measures. It ensures tax credits are distributed to eligible taxpayers, and providing stability through permanent tax provisions. By delaying refunds for certain credits, tightening ITIN regulations, and reinforcing business incentives, the Act promotes tax compliance and reduces identity theft risks. Some provisions may require taxpayers to adjust their filing expectations. However, the overall benefits\u2014including greater security, predictability, and economic support\u2014make the PATH Act a crucial piece of tax legislation that continues to shape the way individuals and businesses navigate their tax obligations.

Further, with the trend of minimalist living, many are turning their primary residences into rental properties. While converting your home to a rental property comes with passive income and tax benefits, it\u2019s important to note the tax implications as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Benefits of Converting Your Primary Residence to a Rental Property<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Passive income is just one of the benefits of converting your home into rental property, but there are plenty of others.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Tax Deductions<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Deducting the expenses related to your rental property can decrease the income reported on your tax return. Every property is different, but the most common <a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/tax-credits-vs-tax-deductions\/\">expenses you can deduct<\/a> include:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Cleaning and maintenance&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Property taxes&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Commission fees&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Repairs &nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Insurance&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mortgage interest&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Depreciation Expenses<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS allows you to depreciate your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.affordabletaxrelief.com\/tax-rules-for-an-airbnb-or-vacation-rental\/\">rental property<\/a> over a 27.5-year period in order to account for things like wear and tear and deterioration. Taxpayers can do this by taking the value of their home at the time of conversion, less the land value, and then dividing it by 27.5 years to calculate the annual depreciation expense. If your depreciation expense is greater than your rental income in a given year, no taxes are owed on the income. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tax Impact of Selling a Rental Property<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the benefits sound nice, it is critical to understand the tax implications that come with not only owning a rental property, but also those that accompany selling one. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Capital Gains<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the selling process, timing is everything because it will determine the amount of capital gains tax paid, if any. Capital gains tax is tax owed on the profit earned on an asset upon selling it. It can be found by a simple calculation:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>Final Sale Price &#8211; (Asset\u2019s Original Cost + Expenses Incurred)<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS Section 121 exclusion allows taxpayers to exclude up to $250,000 of the gain from the sale of your rental property. The amount increases to $500,000 if married filing jointly. To qualify, the taxpayer must own and use the property as their primary residence for two of the past five years. If a taxpayer sells their residence during a time of using the property as their primary residence for only one of the past five years, they would no longer be eligible for the Section 121 exclusion. In this case, the taxpayer would need to report the gain of the sale in their taxable income. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>How Depreciation Affects Capital Gains<\/em><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One key consideration that often catches rental property owners off guard is how depreciation impacts capital gains when the property is sold. When you depreciate a rental property, you&#8217;re essentially reducing your taxable rental income each year based on the property\u2019s wear and tear. However, when it&#8217;s time to sell, the IRS requires that you \u201crecapture\u201d this depreciation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This process is known as depreciation recapture, and it means the total amount of depreciation you\u2019ve claimed over the years is taxed separately\u2014typically at a rate of 25%. This is in addition to any capital gains tax you may owe on the property&#8217;s appreciation in value. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Example Scenario<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You bought a home for $300,000 and lived in it for 5 years. Then, you converted it into a rental property and owned it for another 5 years. During those 5 rental years, you depreciated the property at $9,000 per year, totaling $45,000 in depreciation. Then, you decide to sell the property for $450,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 1: Calculate Adjusted Basis and Gain<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s say your original purchase price was $300,000, and you incurred $5,000 in selling costs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Adjusted basis:<\/strong> $300,000 (purchase price) \u2013 $45,000 (depreciation taken) = $255,000<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Capital gain:<\/strong> $450,000 (sale price) \u2013 $255,000 (adjusted basis) \u2013 $5,000 (selling costs) = $190,000<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 2: Separate Capital Gain and Depreciation Recapture<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Depreciation recapture:<\/strong> $45,000 (taxed at up to 25%)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Remaining capital gain:<\/strong> $190,000 \u2013 $45,000 = <strong>$145,000<\/strong> (taxed at capital gains rates, typically 15% or 20% depending on your income)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 3: Estimate Tax Owed<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Depreciation recapture tax:<\/strong> $45,000 \u00d7 25% = <strong>$11,250<\/strong><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Capital gains tax:<\/strong> $145,000 \u00d7 15% = <strong>$21,75<\/strong>0 (assuming you&#8217;re in the 15% capital gains bracket)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Total estimated taxes owed on sale:<\/strong><br><strong>$11,250 + $21,750 = $33,000<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequently Asked Questions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Q: What are the benefits of converting my primary residence into a rental property?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A; Converting your home into a rental property can provide passive income and various tax benefits, including deductions for expenses like cleaning, repairs, property taxes, mortgage interest, and depreciation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Q: What expenses can I deduct as a rental property owner?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A: You can typically deduct costs such as cleaning and maintenance, property taxes, commission fees, repairs, insurance, mortgage interest, and annual depreciation over 27.5 years.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Q: How does depreciation work for rental properties?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A: The IRS allows you to depreciate the value of your rental property (excluding land) over 27.5 years to account for wear and tear.

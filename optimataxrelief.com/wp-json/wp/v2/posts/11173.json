O<span data-contrast=\"auto\">ne of the most important factors m<\/span>ight be <span data-contrast=\"auto\">the tax implications. While most might be eager to make a huge profit from selling their home, it is critical to understand the tax rules and regulations that apply to this transaction in order to be prepared and make informed decisions. In this post, we will look at the primary tax implications of selling a house<\/span>. This will include <span data-contrast=\"auto\">potential capital gains taxes and exemptions, as well as crucial homeowner concerns.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What are&nbsp;capital gains taxes?<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Some may be shocked to learn that not every home sale needs to be reported to the IRS. That said, if you\u2019re not exempt from reporting your home sale to the IRS, the potential capital gains tax is one of the most important tax implications of selling a house to worry about. Capital gains taxes are taxes paid on the profit made when an investment is sold. These investments can include stocks, bonds, NFTs, jewelry, and of course real estate. Capital gains taxes are extremely complex. Therefore,<\/span> here<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> we will only be focusing on the capital gains taxes paid after the sale of a home.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Do I have to pay taxes on the profit I made from a home sale?<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Whether you\u2019ll have to pay taxes on the profit you earned from the sale will depend on two factors<\/span>. These are<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> how much profit you earned and how long you owned and lived in the home before the sale. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you owned and lived in the home for at least two of five years before its sale, you may exclude up to $250,000 of the profit from your taxable income<\/span>. This amount increases to <span data-contrast=\"auto\">$500,000 if you are married filing jointly. If your profit exceeds the limit ($250,000 or $500,000 for married couples filing jointly), then the excess will be subject to capital gains taxes reported on Schedule D. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">There are some important things to note when determining your eligibility for this tax break. F<\/span>irst,<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> you do need to live in the home for two years out of five before its sale.<\/span> However<span data-contrast=\"auto\">, those two years do not need to be consecutive. The<\/span>refore<span data-contrast=\"auto\">, the home must<\/span>&#8216;<span data-contrast=\"auto\">ve been your primary residence for two out of the five <\/span>years<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> <\/span>before<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> selling it. Finally, you can only exclude this profit from your taxable income if you have not excluded the gain on the sale of another home within two years before this sale. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">How does capital gains tax work in the sale of real estate?<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Let\u2019s look at a few scenarios on how to calculate capital gains tax. Assume you as a single filer purchased a townhome for $350,000 and used it as your primary residence for five years. After five years, you decided to sell the home for $450,000. No capital gains tax would be due because&nbsp;the profit of $100,000 does not exceed the single filer\u2019s exempt amount of $150,000. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Here\u2019s another example. Assume you are a single filer who <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/tax-implications-of-buying-a-house\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">purchased a home<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> for $400,000. After living in the home for two years, you decide to rent it out. Three years pass and you decide to sell the house for $550,000. Because you lived in the home for two of the previous five years and because the profit earned on the house does not exceed the $150,000 exempt amount, no capital gains tax is owed.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Now let\u2019s assume you and your spouse file jointly. You purchase a home for $300,000 and many years later you decide to downsize. You sell your home for $1 million, earning a profit of $700,000. Since this amount exceeds the exempt amount of $500,000 for married couples filing jointly, you and your spouse will owe capital gains tax on the excess amount of $200,000 ($700,000 &#8211; $500,000).<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>2025 Capital Gains Tax Rates<\/em><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Your capital gains rate will depend on your taxable income in the year the home is sold.

Finding out the actual cost of your home and actual gain or loss can quickly become a complex task. Determining your actual cost involves calculating the amount invested into the home through capital investments, like a new roof, updated HVAC, or a remodeled bathroom. Adding these expenses, along with any special tax assessments paid or expenses paid to restore damage after a disaster,&nbsp;to your purchase price will give you what\u2019s called your adjusted basis. Your adjusted basis will help you decrease the amount of gain on the sale since it can increase the cost of your home. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">From there, you will need to subtract credits received from your home.

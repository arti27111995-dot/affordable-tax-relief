Recent data shows that American taxpayers owed over $316 billion in back taxes, penalties, and interest as of the end of 2022. Much of this debt can be attributed to late filing, mathematical errors, and underreported income. Whatever the reason for owing taxes, many taxpayers may find themselves considering tax relief when their tax bills get too large to pay. Here\u2019s an overview of what tax relief is and how it works.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-tax-relief-nbsp\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What Is Tax Relief?<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The IRS recognizes that not all taxpayers can pay their tax debts in full, so it offers formal tax relief programs that include payment extensions, penalty abatement, and debt reduction options tailored to individual circumstances. \u201cTax relief\u201d encompasses managing or settling tax debt through negotiations, payment plans, or programs created for taxpayers facing financial hardship or overwhelming tax bills.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Types of Tax Relief<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tax relief can come in several forms, including tax deductions, tax credits, and tax exemptions, all aimed at easing the financial strain on taxpayers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Tax Deductions<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tax deductions reduce your taxable income, which can lower the amount of taxes you owe. For example, if you earn $50,000 and claim a $1,000 deduction, your taxable income becomes $49,000. Common deductions include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>State and local taxes (SALT)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mortgage interest<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Charitable contributions<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Medical and dental expenses<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Other Deductions<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some deductions fall outside the standard or itemized deduction categories but can still reduce your income. These include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Student loan interest<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Educator classroom expenses<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Contributions to a Health Savings Account (HSA)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Traditional IRA contributions<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Tax Credits<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tax credits directly reduce your tax bill dollar for dollar, unlike deductions, which reduce your taxable income. For example, a $1,000 tax credit will lower your tax bill by $1,000. Some credits are refundable, meaning if the credit exceeds your tax bill, you can receive the difference as a refund. Others are non-refundable, which means they only reduce your bill to zero but don\u2019t generate a refund for any leftover amount.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Common tax credits include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Child Tax Credit<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) for higher education<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Energy-efficiency tax credits for eligible home improvements<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Tax Exemptions<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tax exemptions allow certain income or individuals to be excluded from tax altogether. Although personal and dependent exemptions were eliminated after the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, exemptions still exist in other areas:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Non-profit organizations may be granted tax-exempt status under IRS Code 501(c)(3)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some investment income may be exempt from federal taxes, such as municipal bond interest<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-does-tax-relief-work-nbsp\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">How Does Tax Relief Work?<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Tax liability relief is not a \u201cone-size-fits-all&#8221; program. Every tax relief program works differently, and the process will also differ depending on the individual taxpayer\u2019s situation.

An OIC allows you to settle your tax debt for less than what you owe. When selecting OIC candidates, the IRS will examine your ability to pay your tax bill, your income and expenses, and the value of your assets.\u00a0There are three types of OICs:\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Doubt as to Collectibility:<\/strong> When there\u2019s doubt the IRS could collect the full debt.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Doubt as to Liability:<\/strong> When there\u2019s uncertainty about the correctness of the tax debt.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Effective Tax Administration: <\/strong>When collecting the full amount would be unfair or cause economic hardship.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Applying for an <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/offer-in-compromise\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Offer in Compromise<\/a> involves a detailed process, beginning with completing IRS Form 656, &#8220;Offer in Compromise.&#8221; Alongside this form, taxpayers must submit a comprehensive financial statement detailing income, expenses, assets, and liabilities. There are some basic requirements for an offer in compromise including:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Must pay a $205 nonrefundable application fee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Must make a nonrefundable initial payment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Must be current on all tax returns&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Must not be in an open bankruptcy proceeding&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If the IRS deems that you cannot afford to pay your tax debt, or that paying your tax debt will result in financial hardship, then it may accept your offer in compromise.

The IRS will request information regarding your income and expenses to determine your eligibility. If approved, the CNC status will temporarily cease collections on your account. However, they will continue to assess interest and penalties to your account. They will continue to review your income each year to determine if you are still eligible for CNC status. They can also still file a tax lien against you during this time and keep your tax refunds to apply them to your tax bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-irs-installment-agreement-nbsp\"><b><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">IRS Installment Agreement<\/span><\/i><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you can\u2019t pay your tax debt in full but don\u2019t qualify for an OIC, an <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/services\/tax-negotiation\/installment-plans\/\">IRS installment agreement<\/a> may be a practical solution. An IRS installment agreement lets you pay your tax bill, plus accrued interest and penalties, over a set period of time in monthly installments. <\/span>There are different types of installment agreements:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Guaranteed Installment Agreement: <\/strong>If you owe $10,000 or less and meet other criteria, the IRS is required to grant this agreement.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Streamlined Installment Agreement: <\/strong>For tax debt of $50,000 or less, you can qualify without submitting detailed financials.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Non-Streamlined Installment Agreement: <\/strong>For tax debt of more than $50,000, you can qualify based on financial information you provide to the IRS.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Partial Payment Installment Agreement (PPIA):<\/strong> This allows you to pay a reduced amount monthly if you cannot afford the full payment but do not qualify for an OIC. &nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>While an IRS installment agreement does not reduce your tax bill, or exclude you from penalties and interest, it might be your next best option to pay off your tax debt. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-penalty-abatement-nbsp\"><b><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Penalty Abatement<\/span><\/i><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Sometimes life gets in the way of responsibility.

However, if you have an existing tax lien, that can negatively affect your credit. Resolving tax debt could improve your financial standing over time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-much-will-the-irs-usually-settle-for\"><strong><em>How much will the IRS usually settle for?<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS generally settles for an amount that reflects your ability to pay, which can be significantly less than the total debt. To determine this, the IRS will consider your assets, income, monthly expenses, savings, and other factors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-are-there-tax-relief-options-for-disaster-victims-nbsp\"><strong><em>Are there tax relief options for disaster victims?<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/what-is-the-federal-disaster-tax-relief-act\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">disaster victims<\/a> may qualify for tax relief such as extended filing and payment deadlines, waived penalties, and deductions for uninsured losses. The IRS often provides specific guidance and updates for affected areas.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-happens-if-i-can-t-pay-my-taxes-nbsp\"><strong><em>What happens if I can&#8217;t pay my taxes?<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can\u2019t pay your taxes, the IRS may charge penalties and interest, but you can explore options like installment agreements, offers in compromise, or currently not collectible status. It\u2019s important to file your tax return on time to avoid additional penalties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>How do I claim and document education-related tax credits?<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>File Form 8863 with your return and use Form 1098-T to claim education credits like the AOTC or LLC. Keep receipts for tuition and required materials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-which-specific-expenses-qualify-for-itemized-deductions-in-2025\"><strong><em>Which specific expenses qualify for itemized deductions in 2025?<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Qualifying 2025 deductions include SALT (up to $40,000), mortgage interest, medical expenses over 7.5% of AGI, charitable donations, and disaster losses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>How often and by how much do standard deduction limits adjust for inflation?<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Standard deduction limits adjust yearly for inflation. For 2025, they rose to $15,000 (single) and $31,500 (married filing jointly).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Can taxpayers use both an Offer in Compromise and an Installment Agreement concurrently?<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No. Submitting an Offer in Compromise suspends any existing Installment Agreement during IRS review.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>What financial records must I submit with Form 656 for an Offer in Compromise?<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Include Form 433-A or 433-B (OIC) with income, expenses, bank statements, pay stubs, and asset details.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-do-i-proceed-with-tax-relief-nbsp\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">How Do I Proceed with Tax Relief?<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If one of these tax relief options sounds like they can be of help to your tax situation, you should consider pursuing it.

Recent data shows that American taxpayers owed over $316 billion in back taxes, penalties, and interest as of the end of 2022. Much of this debt can be attributed to late filing, mathematical errors, and underreported income. Whatever the reason for owing taxes, many taxpayers may find themselves considering tax relief when their tax bills get too large to pay. Here\u2019s an overview of what tax relief is and how it works.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What Is Tax Relief?<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The phrase \u201ctax relief\u201d can mean many things. When speaking of tax debt, tax relief is when your tax debt is managed, settled through negotiations, or paid down with payment plans. Tax relief programs were created for taxpayers who cannot afford to pay their tax bills, as well as those who have overwhelming and overdue tax bills.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">How Does Tax Relief Work?<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Tax relief is not a \u201cone-size-fits-all\" program.

An OIC allows you to <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/what-is-a-tax-settlement\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">settle your tax debt<\/a> for less than what you owe. When selecting OIC candidates, the IRS will examine your ability to pay your tax bill, your income and expenses, and the value of your assets.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Applying for an Offer in Compromise involves a detailed process, beginning with completing IRS Form 656, \"Offer in Compromise.\" Alongside this form, taxpayers must submit a comprehensive financial statement detailing income, expenses, assets, and liabilities.

The IRS will request information regarding your income and expenses to determine your eligibility. If approved, the CNC status will temporarily cease collections on your account.

To qualify for a short-term installment agreement, you cannot owe more than $100,000 in combined tax, penalties and interest. A long-term payment plan can be paid over 180+ days. To qualify for a long-term installment agreement, you must not owe more than $50,000 in combined tax, penalties and interest. While an <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/how-irs-installment-agreements-work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">IRS installment agreement<\/a> does not reduce your tax bill, or exclude you from penalties and interest, it might be your next best option to pay off your tax debt. \u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Penalty Abatement<\/span><\/i><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Sometimes life gets in the way of responsibility.

Inflation doesn\u2019t stop at gas and housing, though, as the state of the economy also impacts your taxes. The IRS updates certain tax provisions annually to account for inflation, so your tax and investment plans should change accordingly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Inflation and Standard Deductions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Standard deductions rise during inflated tax years. For 2022, the deduction for joint filers is expected to rise to $25,900; an $800 difference. Single filers and married taxpayers filing separately now have a standard deduction of $12,950. This is a $400 difference from last year. Heads of households now have a standard deduction of $19,400 for 2022, which is a $600 difference. The 401(k) limit has been increased as well, making it $20,500.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2022 Marginal Rates During Inflation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The marginal rates (based on income level) are as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Incomes greater than $539,900 ($647,850 for joint filing) have a rate of 37%<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Incomes greater than $215,950 ($431,900 for joint filing) have a rate of 35%<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Incomes greater than $170,050 ($340,100 for joint filing) have a rate of 32%<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Incomes greater than $89,075 ($178,150 for joint filing) have a rate of 24%<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Incomes greater than $41,775 ($83,550 for joint filing) have a rate of 22%<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Incomes greater than $10,275 ($20,550 for joint filing) have a rate of 12%<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Incomes of $10,275 or less ($20,550 or less if filing jointly) have a rate of 10%<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Alternative Minimum Tax During Inflation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The AMT tax exemption for the 2022 tax year has also increased due to the economy. It is now $75,900 and begins to phase out when your income reaches $539,900. Married couples filing jointly have a minimum of $118,100 and begins to phase out at $1,079,800.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What You Can Expect<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the IRS has made some inflation adjustments, several provisions of the tax code have yet to be amended. This means that taxpayers will pay more for the 2022 tax year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should review your spending and update your financial plans and investment accounts to avoid problems with the IRS in the future. Not all taxpayers may be affected by the inflation, but some state and federal provisions have not been updated to reflect the times. A tax professional can help you plan according to your state provisions and your current income level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">For Assistance with Tax Debt During Inflation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our tax professionals will review your case and inform you on how to move forward in your tax relief journey.

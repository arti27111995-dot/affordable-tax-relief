New Orleans Saints quarterback, Drew Brees for instance, is averaging $20 million a year. Most team members don\u2019t make anywhere near that, but rest assured they are well paid.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Big Bucks Big Taxes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>NFL players also have enormous out-of-pocket expenses. Naturally they can write off all the usual items as long as they qualify. But what else can they deduct?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Agent fees, which are generally a percentage of a player\u2019s income. These max out at 3% but for other income such as endorsements the fees are higher.<\/li>\n<li>Ground transportation costs (taxis, parking fees, and tolls) related to away-games, training, meeting with agents, scouts, trainers, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Fines for acts which do not violate public law.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&#8220;I am often asked if player fines are deductible,&#8221; said CPA Robert A. Raiola. &#8220;For example a fine for speeding is not deductible but a fine for being late to practice is deductible because it violates team policy, but not public law.&#8221; Many people believe fines are deductible because some leagues, including the NFL, donate this money to charity. \u201cThat\u2019s a common misconception. Whether the fines are donated or not, they are deductible to the athletes,\u201d said Raiola. Raiola is head of the Sports &amp; Entertainment Group for the New Jersey-based accounting firm of Fazio, Mannuzza, Roche, Tankel, LaPilusa, LLC.<\/p>\n<p>Additional expenses include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Athletic equipment related to his sport. Also deductible are training classes and general workout equipment classes which are part of his overall athletic development.<\/li>\n<li>Therapeutic massages may be deductible.<\/li>\n<li>Reasonable costs of chiropractic care and body maintenance fees, during the season.<\/li>\n<li>Temporary housing, for a definite time period, such as for rehab after an injury.<\/li>\n<li>Rookie expenses.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Rookies are generally expected to take the team or a position group out for meals at times. It\u2019s considered a normal business expense in the NFL, and generally it is deductible, subject to the standard 50% meals and entertainment limit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Lesson?<br \/>\n<\/strong><br \/>\nThe deductions are out there, but it takes the expertise of a trained professional to get the best tax results. That\u2019s true for anyone who receives a large sum of money from any source, such as a <a title=\"How Gambling Impacts Your Taxes\" href=\"https:\/\/www.affordabletaxrelief.com\/how-gambling-impacts-your-taxes\/\">lottery win<\/a>, a legal settlement, an inheritance, life insurance, a gift. You&#8217;ve heard the stories of people who were suddenly rich, rolling in money. A few years later they are flatbroke, bankrupt, in tax debt, and with no idea how it happened.<\/p>\n<p>The problem was, they had money coming out their ears, but what they didn&#8217;t have was the financial sophistication to handle the money well, guard their assets, and minimize the tax bill. For anyone who gets a large sum of money from any source, the first dollar spent should be to get a <a title=\"affordable Tax Relief\" href=\"https:\/\/www.affordabletaxrelief.com\">good financial professional<\/a> on your side.

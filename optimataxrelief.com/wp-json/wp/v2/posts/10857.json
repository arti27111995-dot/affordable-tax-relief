Calculate all gross income you earned this past year, even if the job was nontraditional like gig work or freelancing. Remember gross <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/which-income-types-are-not-taxable\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">income<\/a> is the amount you earned before taxes or deductions were taken out. There are a lot of rules surrounding filing requirements, but in 2024, you must file if you meet one of the following scenarios:\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Filing Status<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/td><td><strong>Age at the end of 2023<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/td><td><strong>Must file if gross income is at least:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Single&nbsp;<\/td><td>Under 65&nbsp;<\/td><td>$13,850&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Single&nbsp;<\/td><td>65 or Older&nbsp;<\/td><td>$15,700&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Head of Household&nbsp;<\/td><td>Under 65&nbsp;<\/td><td>$20,800&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Head of Household&nbsp;<\/td><td>65 or Older&nbsp;<\/td><td>$22,650&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Married Filing Jointly&nbsp;<\/td><td>Under 65 (Both Spouses)&nbsp;<\/td><td>$27,700&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Married Filing Jointly&nbsp;<\/td><td>65 or Older (One Spouse)&nbsp;<\/td><td>$29,200&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Married Filing Jointly&nbsp;<\/td><td>65 or Older (Both Spouses)&nbsp;<\/td><td>$30,700&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Married Filing Separate&nbsp;<\/td><td>Any Age&nbsp;<\/td><td>$5&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Qualified Widow(er)&nbsp;<\/td><td>Under 65&nbsp;<\/td><td>$27,700&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Qualified Widow(er)&nbsp;<\/td><td>65 or Older&nbsp;<\/td><td>$29,200&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The rules are different if your parents provide financial assistance, either through living expenses, education, or a monthly allowance. If this is the case, your parents might be able to claim you as a <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/dependents-and-your-taxes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">dependent<\/a>. If you can be claimed on someone else\u2019s tax return as a dependent, you still might have to file a tax return of your own. Single dependents must do so if any of the following applied to them in 2023:\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Unearned income was more than $1,250&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Earned income was more than $13,850&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Gross income was more than the larger of:&nbsp;\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>$1,250, or\u00a0<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Earned income (up to $13,450) plus $400\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These same criteria apply to married dependents as well. Furthermore, they have an additional criterion that applies:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Gross income was at least $5, and spouse filed separately and itemized their deductions&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, unearned income includes any money earned by doing nothing. Examples include investment income or rental property income. Earned income is the money you earn from work like salaries, tips, and self-employment income. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Decide <\/strong><strong>H<\/strong><strong>ow to <\/strong><strong>F<\/strong><strong>ile&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest and fastest way to file a tax return is electronically. You can use a tax software to prepare and file a return for you if your tax situation is simple. The IRS offers free tax preparation through IRS Free File, a program ideal for young and first-time filers. There is also online tax preparation software that is free for simple federal tax filings. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Collect <\/strong><strong>A<\/strong><strong>ll <\/strong><strong>Y<\/strong><strong>our <\/strong><strong>T<\/strong><strong>ax <\/strong><strong>D<\/strong><strong>ocuments&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a first-time filer you might need the following items to file:&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Income forms, including <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/a-breakdown-of-irs-form-w-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">W-2s<\/a> and 1099s&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Education expense forms, including Form 1098-T, receipts, scholarship records&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Social security number&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Routing and account numbers for direct deposit&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dependent information (if applicable), including names, date of birth, SSNs, etc. \u00a0\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Find Credits and Deductions<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even first-time filers are eligible for credits and deductions. A tax credit is a dollar-for-dollar reduction of your income. Some credits you may be eligible for are:&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>American Opportunity Tax Credit<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Worth up to $2,500 per student, the AOTC allows you to claim a credit for tuition, fees and course materials. You can use Form 1098-T to determine your credit amount. Your school will either mail this form or make it available to you by January 31 each year.&nbsp;You cannot claim this credit if you are listed as a dependent on another tax return or earn above certain income limits.&nbsp;Just be sure you are eligible for this credit before claiming it. If you wrongly claim it, the IRS can make you pay back the amount you received, plus interest. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Lifetime Learning Credit<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This credit is worth up to $2,000 per tax return and is for qualified tuition and related expenses paid for education, excluding course materials. You cannot claim this credit if you are listed as a dependent on another tax return or earn above certain income limits.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Tax Deductions<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A tax deduction is&nbsp;a reduction of taxable income to lower your tax bill. You can claim the standard deduction of $13,850 for single filers in tax year 2023, as it will likely result in a lower tax bill than if you were to itemize deductions. Additionally, you can deduct student loan interest payments you make even if you do not itemize deductions. If you use your car for business purposes, you can deduct your mileage. The 2023 <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/2024-irs-mileage-rates\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">standard mileage rate<\/a> is 65.5 cents per mile. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>File <\/strong><strong>B<\/strong><strong>y the <\/strong><strong>D<\/strong><strong>eadline&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you\u2019re ready to file, you should be sure to submit your return by the tax deadline. In 2024, the deadline is April 15th. If you are getting a refund, you can have it sent by paper check or direct deposit. Direct deposit is the fastest way to receive your federal refund and you can track its status on the IRS website. You can also track your state refund online. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tax Help for First-Time Taxpayers&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First-time filers should note that filling your tax return by the tax deadline is critical. If you prepare your return and find that you owe taxes, don\u2019t panic. You will need to pay your tax bill by the April deadline or request an extension to file. If approved, you have until October 16, 2024. Do not ignore your tax bill as this can lead to greater financial stress later. You should also figure out why you owe so you can avoid this problem again next tax season. Common reasons for owing are not withholding enough taxes during the year or not making quarterly estimated payments if you do not withhold any taxes from your income. When in doubt, ask for help.

Now that we know the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/1099-explained-the-basics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">basics of IRS Form 1099<\/a>, we can take a closer look at the different types of 1099s you can receive. Remember, if you received any income outside your employer, you might receive a 1099. While most types of Form 1099 are not commonly received, there are a handful that you are likely to come across at some point. Whether you are an independent contractor, an investor, or someone who has received unemployment benefits, understanding the different types of 1099s can help you stay compliant with tax laws and avoid surprises during tax season. Here\u2019s an overview of the different types of Form 1099.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Common Types of 1099<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Receiving a 1099 is more common than you\u2019d think. You can receive a 1099 if you have a side gig, earn interest on a bank account, or sell stocks. Let\u2019s review the most common types of 1099.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><em><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1099-MISC: Miscellaneous Income<\/span><\/em><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><em>&nbsp;<\/em><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1099-MISC is used to report various types of income that do not fall under the category of non-employee compensation. This includes rent payments, royalties, awards, medical and health care payments, crop insurance proceeds, attorney payments, legal settlements, and others. Businesses that pay at least $600 in rent to a landlord, for example, must issue a 1099-MISC. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider a scenario where a business leases office space from an independent property owner and pays $1,200 per month in rent. By the end of the year, the business has paid $14,400 in total rent. The landlord should receive a 1099-MISC documenting these payments, which they must report as rental income on their tax return.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><em><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1099-NEC: Nonemployee Compensation<\/span><\/em><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><em>&nbsp;<\/em><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most frequently issued 1099 forms is the 1099-NEC. The 1099-NEC form is used to report non-employee compensation, including <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/tax-tips-for-doordash-and-uber-eats-drivers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">independent contractors<\/a>, freelancers, sole proprietors, and self-employed individuals. If you received $600 or more in non-employee compensation during the tax year, you should receive a 1099-NEC. This form is used to report payments made for services rendered. These might include&nbsp;consulting fees, professional services, and other types of compensation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a small business hires a freelance graphic designer to create a new logo and pays them $1,500 over the course of the year. Since the total payment exceeds the $600 threshold, the business must issue a 1099-NEC to the designer and report the payment to the IRS. Unlike traditional employees, independent contractors do not have taxes withheld from their earnings. This means they are responsible for making estimated tax payments throughout the year to cover income tax and self-employment tax obligations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><em><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1099-INT: Interest Income<\/span><\/em><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><em>&nbsp;<\/em><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Banks, credit unions, and financial institutions issue 1099-INT forms to individuals who earn interest income. This includes interest from savings accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), and U.S. Treasury bonds. If you earned more than $10 in interest income, the financial institution is required to disburse&nbsp;a Form 1099-INT. The form will go both to you and the IRS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suppose a taxpayer holds a high-yield savings account that generates $750 in interest over the year. The bank will send them a 1099-INT, which must be included on their tax return as taxable income. Even if the taxpayer does not receive the interest as cash\u2014such as in the case of a reinvested bond\u2014it still must be reported.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><em><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1099-DIV: Dividends and Distributions<\/span><\/em><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><em>&nbsp;<\/em><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Form 1099-DIV is used to report dividends and distributions that are paid to you during the tax year, as well as any federal income tax withheld. This can include ordinary dividends, which are paid out of a company\u2019s earnings and profits, qualified dividends, capital gain distributions, and non-dividend distributions. It does not include any dividends that you accrued through tax-sheltered retirement accounts. You will typically receive a 1099-INT if you received at least $10 in dividend income.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, an individual who owns shares in a dividend-paying stock earns $1,200 in dividends throughout the year. Their brokerage firm will send them a 1099-DIV summarizing these payments. If some of the dividends qualify for a lower tax rate, they will be classified as &#8220;qualified dividends&#8221; on the form.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><em><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1099-K: Payment Card and Third-Party Network Transactions<\/span><\/em><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><em>&nbsp;<\/em><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Form 1099-K is meant to track payments made through third-party networks, such as PayPal, Venmo, or credit card transactions. This form is issued when total transactions exceed a specific threshold. For tax year 2024, the threshold for reporting is $5,000, meaning businesses or individuals who receive more than this amount through third-party networks will receive a 1099-K in 2025. The <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/how-to-prepare-for-the-new-1099k-thresholds-in-2025\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">threshold for tax year 2025 is $2,500<\/a>, and it will decrease to just $600 in 2026. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, a small bakery that accepts credit card payments through Square receives $5,000 in transactions over the course of the year. Square will issue a 1099-K to report this income. If the bakery owner also accepts cash payments, those earnings must be self-reported, as they will not be included on the 1099-K.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Other Common Types of 1099<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let\u2019s look at some other types of 1099. These are not the most common, but you are likely to come across these at some point in life. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><em>1099-B, Proceeds from Broker and Barter Exchange Transactions<\/em><\/span><\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This form&nbsp;reports the sale of stock, bonds, and other securities through a broker, as well as barter exchange transactions. It includes details on the sale price, cost basis, and whether the transaction resulted in a capital gain or loss. These transactions must be reported even if you had a loss or broke even.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><em>1099-G, Certain Government Payments<\/em><\/span><\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This&nbsp;reports payments you received from government agencies, including unemployment, tax refunds, taxable grants, and more. Since unemployment income is generally taxable at the federal level, recipients may need to pay taxes on these benefits when filing their return.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><em>1099-R, Distributions from Pensions, Annuities, Retirement or Profit-Sharing Plans, IRAs, Insurance Contracts, etc.<\/em><\/span><\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This&nbsp;reports distributions from annuities, profit-sharing plans, retirement plans, IRAs, insurance contracts, or pensions. Withdrawals from these accounts may be subject to income tax, and in some cases, early withdrawals before age 59\u00bd may incur additional penalties. You should consult with a tax professional about whether you will owe tax on these distributions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><em>1099-S, Proceeds from Real Estate Transactions<\/em><\/span><\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>1099-S&nbsp;reports the <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/tax-implications-of-selling-a-house\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sale or exchange of real estate<\/a>. The form reports the gross proceeds from the sale, which may be subject to capital gains tax depending on the seller&#8217;s circumstances.&nbsp;If the property was your primary residence for two of the five years before the sale, then up to $250,000 of the profit is exempt from taxes. This amount increases to $500,000 for married couples filing jointly. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><em>1099-SA, Distributions From an HSA, Archer MSA, or Medicare Advantage MSA<\/em><\/span><\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This form reports distributions made from a health savings account (HSA), Archer Medical Savings Account (Archer MSA), or a Medicare Advantage Medical Savings Account (MA MSA). Distributions can be taxable if they were used to pay for qualified medical expenses, if they were not rolled over in some cases, if excess contributions were made, and other scenarios. You should consult with a tax professional about whether you will owe tax on these distributions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">L<\/span><\/b>ess Common <b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Types of 1099<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let\u2019s review the less common types of 1099. Remember, even if these are less common, the IRS is still diligently tracking which tax forms are reported. Be sure to include all 1099 income on your tax return.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><em>1099-A, Acquisition or Abandonment of Secured Property<\/em><\/span><\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>1099-A <span data-contrast=\"auto\">reports foreclosures on properties. You may be liable for capital gains tax and income tax for any unpaid foreclosed mortgage balances. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><em>1099-C, Cancellation of Debt<\/em><\/span><\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This form <span data-contrast=\"auto\">reports discharged, forgiven, or canceled debt. This can include your property foreclosure or forgiven credit card debt but typically excludes debt discharged in bankruptcy. You will need to claim the amount&nbsp;reported on your 1099-C as taxable income. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><em>1099-CAP, Changes in Corporate Control and Capital Structure<\/em><\/span><\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Form 1099-CAP <span data-contrast=\"auto\">reports the amount of cash, stock, or property received after a significant change in the company\u2019s control or capital structure.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>1099-DA, Digital Asset Proceeds From Broker Transactions<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Form 1099-DA reports digital asset transactions, including crypto trades. It requires brokers to report users&#8217; transaction details to the IRS, similar to how stock trades are reported on Form 1099-B.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><em>1099-H, Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) Advance Payments<\/em><\/span><\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This <span data-contrast=\"auto\">reports any advance payments&nbsp;of qualified health insurance payments you received. If you qualify for trade adjustment assistance (TAA), alternative TAA (ATAA), reemployment TAA (RTAA), or Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), you might see this form.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><em>1099-LTC, Long Term Care and Accelerated Death Benefits<\/em><\/span><\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/irs-form-1099-ltc-explained\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Form 1099-LTC<\/a>&nbsp;reports payments made under a long-term care insurance contract. This includes accelerated death benefits, or benefits received before death because the policyholder has been deemed terminally ill by a doctor.&nbsp; The amount shown on the 1099-LTC are generally tax-free but are required to be reported to the IRS.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><em>1099-LS, Reportable Life Insurance Sale<\/em><\/span><\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This form <span data-contrast=\"auto\">reports the amount paid to you from a life insurance sale.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><em>1099-OID, Original Issue Discount<\/em><\/span><\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>1099-OID <span data-contrast=\"auto\">reports $10 or more of&nbsp;income received when bonds, notes, or certificates of deposit (CDs) are sold at a discount from their maturity value. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><em>1099-PATR, Taxable Distributions Received from Cooperatives<\/em><\/span><\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This r<span data-contrast=\"auto\">eports at least $10 in patronage dividends and other distributions from a cooperative (co-op) in the prior year.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><em>1099-Q, Payments from Qualified Education Programs<\/em><\/span><\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>1099-Q r<span data-contrast=\"auto\">eports total withdrawals from qualified tuition programs (QTPs) like 529 plans or Coverdell educational savings accounts.

If the information is incorrect, request a correction from the issuer. Failing to report 1099 income can result in IRS penalties, so ensure all taxable amounts are included in your return. Maintaining proper records throughout the year can help simplify tax filing. If you have multiple 1099s or complex income sources, consulting a tax professional can help you navigate potential deductions and minimize tax liability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Tax Help for Those Who Receive 1099s<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The types of Form 1099 and the accompanying filing requirements can quickly become complicated. You should always consult with a tax professional if you are unsure about your tax filing requirements. Remember, even if you do not receive a 1099 for income earned, it\u2019s still your responsibility to include it in your taxable income. Not doing so can be a major red flag to the IRS and can result in an audit.

The tax breaks for homeowners can include both deductions, which reduce your taxable income, and credits, which reduce your tax bill dollar\u2011for\u2011dollar. Understanding which ones apply to you could mean hundreds or even thousands of dollars in savings each year. In this guide, we\u2019ll break down the most valuable homeowner tax benefits, from mortgage interest and property taxes to energy\u2011efficiency credits, home sale exclusions, and more. We\u2019ll also cover important limits, documentation requirements, and timing considerations so you can plan ahead.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Understanding Tax Breaks for Homeowners<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we dive into specific <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/tax-credits-vs-tax-deductions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">deductions and credits<\/a>, it\u2019s important to understand the difference:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Tax deductions lower your taxable income. <\/strong>For example, if you have $80,000 in taxable income and claim a $5,000 deduction, you\u2019ll be taxed on $75,000 instead.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Tax credits directly reduce your tax liability. <\/strong>If you owe $3,000 in taxes and have a $1,000 credit, your tax bill drops to $2,000.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Both types can help homeowners, but they work in different ways. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Mortgage Interest Deduction<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For many homeowners, the mortgage interest deduction is the most significant tax break. If you itemize your deductions instead of taking the standard deduction, you can generally deduct interest paid on loans used to buy, build, or substantially improve your primary or second home.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Key Rules<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You can deduct interest on up to $750,000 of qualifying mortgage debt if the loan originated after December 15, 2017. For older mortgages, the limit is $1 million.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Married couples filing separately have a $375,000 limit for newer loans ($500,000 for older ones). \u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The deduction applies to both first and second homes, as long as they meet IRS definitions.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Mortgage Interest Deduction Example<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you bought your home in 2022 for $600,000 with a 6% interest rate, you may have paid roughly $35,000 in interest in the first year. If you itemize, you could deduct the entire amount. This could potentially save thousands depending on your tax bracket. The amount you can deduct will be shown on Form 1098, which you\u2019ll receive from your lender each January. Keep this for your records.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Property Tax Deduction<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you itemize your deductions, you may be able to deduct the property taxes you\u2019ve paid on your home and other real estate you own. However, there are important rules, limits, and exceptions to understand before claiming this tax break.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>What Counts as Deductible Property Taxes<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can deduct real estate taxes on your primary residence and any other real property you own, starting from the date you take legal ownership. This date is typically listed on your settlement statement at closing. If you agree to pay the seller\u2019s overdue taxes from a prior year as part of the purchase, you cannot deduct those payments. They\u2019re considered part of your home\u2019s purchase cost, not a property tax deduction.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certain charges on your property tax bill may look like taxes but aren\u2019t deductible. Common examples include fees for trash collection or water service, fines for code violations, and local benefit assessments like sidewalk or road construction. Only maintenance or repair costs that are itemized separately by the taxing authority may be deductible.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>SALT Deduction Limits <\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For tax years 2018 through 2024, the total deduction for <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/what-is-the-salt-deduction\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">state and local taxes<\/a> (SALT), including property taxes, is capped at $10,000 per return ($5,000 if married filing separately). In 2025, the cap temporarily increases to $40,000, though the limit may be reduced for higher\u2011income taxpayers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Property Taxes Paid Through Escrow<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you pay property taxes through your monthly mortgage escrow, you can only deduct the amount your lender actually paid to the tax authority during the year. This figure is often listed on Form 1098 but can also be confirmed through your property tax receipts.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Mortgage Points Deduction<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you buy a home, you might pay mortgage points to lower your interest rate. Mortgage points are upfront fees you pay to your lender at closing to lower your interest rate on a home loan. One point typically costs 1% of the loan amount and reduces the rate by a small percentage, which can save you money over time if you keep the mortgage long enough. These points can be deducted as prepaid interest if certain IRS conditions are met.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Mortgage Points Deduction Example<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you paid $6,000 for points on a $600,000 loan, you may be able to deduct the full amount in the year you purchased the home. This is provided the loan was for your primary residence and other IRS rules apply. If not, you may need to spread the deduction over the life of the loan.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Home Equity Loan Interest<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Interest on home equity loans and lines of credit (HELOCs) may still be deductible if the borrowed funds are used to buy, build, or substantially improve the home securing the loan. Using the funds for personal expenses like vacations or debt consolidation does not qualify. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Home Equity Loan Interest Example<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you use a $50,000 HELOC to remodel your kitchen, the interest could be deductible. But if you use the same $50,000 to pay off credit cards, it won\u2019t qualify.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (IRC 25C)<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/can-i-claim-an-energy-tax-credit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">energy tax credit<\/a>, available through 2025, covers 30% of the cost of certain energy\u2011efficient upgrades to your home, with annual limits.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Eligible Improvements<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Energy\u2011efficient doors, windows, and skylights\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Insulation\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>HVAC systems, including heat pumps\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Water heaters\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Home energy audits\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Limits<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Up to $1,200 per year for most improvements\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Up to $2,000 per year for heat pumps, biomass stoves, and certain water heaters\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Example<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you install $5,000 worth of qualifying windows in 2025, you could claim a $1,500 credit (30% of the cost), but since the annual limit for windows is $600, your credit would be capped at that amount.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Residential Clean Energy Credit (IRC 25D)<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you install renewable energy systems such as solar panels, wind turbines, geothermal systems, or certain battery storage, you may qualify for this credit.

It\u2019s available only to homeowners who receive a Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) from a state or local housing finance agency.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MCC is worth up to 20% of your annual mortgage interest that can be claimed as a dollar\u2011for\u2011dollar tax credit against your federal income tax liability.

Be sure to keep records of major improvements, as they increase your cost basis and can reduce taxable gain. For example, a $50,000 kitchen remodel increases your basis, which could help you stay under the exclusion threshold.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>State and Local Incentives<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond federal programs, many states and municipalities offer additional homeowner tax incentives, often focused on energy efficiency or home improvements. For example, California offers rebates for solar panels and battery storage that can be combined with federal credits. Texas offers property tax exemptions for certain renewable energy installations. Check with your state\u2019s energy office or local government for current programs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Timing and Compliance Considerations<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some homeowner tax breaks are set to expire or phase out in the coming years. For instance, the Residential Clean Energy Credit expires after 2025 under the One Big Beautiful Bill. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Documentation and Forms<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To claim these tax breaks, maintain thorough records:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Form 1098 for mortgage interest\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Property tax bills and proof of payment\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Receipts and invoices for home improvements\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Manufacturer certifications for energy\u2011efficient products\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Form 5695 for energy credits\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping organized documentation not only makes filing easier but also protects you in case of an IRS audit.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Frequently Asked Questions<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>What can a homeowner write off on taxes?<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Homeowners may be able to deduct mortgage interest, <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/are-property-taxes-deductible\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">property taxes<\/a>, mortgage points, and in some cases interest on home equity loans or lines of credit. Those who qualify may also claim tax credits for energy\u2011efficient or renewable energy home improvements.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Can I deduct home improvements on my taxes?<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most home improvements are not immediately deductible, but upgrades that increase your home\u2019s value can reduce capital gains taxes when you sell by increasing your cost basis. Certain energy\u2011efficient improvements may qualify for a federal tax credit worth up to 30% of the cost. These, however, will expire after 2025.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Are closing costs tax deductible?<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most closing costs are not deductible, but some, like mortgage points paid to reduce your interest rate, may be deductible in the year you buy your home. Other costs, such as property taxes paid at closing, may also be deductible if you itemize.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Can you deduct home utilities on taxes?<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In most cases, you cannot deduct home utilities like electricity, gas, or water. However, if you have a qualifying home office for business purposes, you may be able to deduct a portion of your utility costs based on the percentage of your home used for business.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Should I get a tax refund if I bought a house?<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buying a home doesn\u2019t automatically mean you\u2019ll get a tax refund, but you may qualify for deductions and credits that lower your tax bill. Whether you receive a refund depends on your overall tax situation, including income, withholdings, and other deductions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tax-help-for-homeowners-nbsp\"><strong>Tax Help for Homeowners<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The tax code offers homeowners numerous ways to save, from deductions like mortgage interest and property taxes to credits for energy\u2011efficient upgrades and renewable energy systems.

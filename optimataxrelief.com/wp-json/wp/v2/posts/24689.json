Alongside the emotional toll, many surviving spouses also face the stress of handling estate and tax matters. One of the most common questions widows ask is: \u201cWill I owe taxes on my spouse\u2019s estate?\u201d This article will walk you through key estate tax considerations for widows, including what you might owe, how to minimize your tax burden, and what steps to take to protect your financial future.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-estate-tax-and-does-it-apply-to-you-nbsp\"><strong>What Is Estate Tax, and Does It Apply to You?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Estate tax is a federal tax on the transfer of someone\u2019s assets after they die. The IRS only applies this tax if the total value of the estate is above a certain threshold, called the estate tax exemption. For 2025, the federal exemption is $13.99 million per person. Starting in 2026, the estate tax exemption is increased to $15 million per person under the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB). This amount will be adjusted annually for inflation going forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if your late spouse\u2019s estate is worth less than that, there likely won\u2019t be any federal estate tax due.\u00a0This is different from inheritance tax, which is imposed on the person receiving the assets (not the estate itself) and is only charged in a few states. Most <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/qualifying-widower-filing-status-explained\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">surviving spouses<\/a> don\u2019t have to pay inheritance tax, even in those states. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-unlimited-marital-deduction-nbsp\"><strong>The Unlimited Marital Deduction<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most important estate tax rules for surviving spouses is the unlimited marital deduction. This means that all assets left to a surviving spouse pass tax-free, no matter the value. For example, if your spouse left you $15 million, you wouldn\u2019t owe federal estate tax on that amount, even though it\u2019s over the $13.99 million exemption, because it\u2019s going to a spouse. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it&#8217;s crucial to understand that while the unlimited marital deduction defers estate taxes, it doesn&#8217;t eliminate them. When the surviving spouse passes away, the estate may be subject to tax if it\u2019s large enough. That\u2019s why proper planning is crucial, even if there\u2019s no immediate tax due. It\u2019s also crucial to understand that the unlimited marital deduction only applies if the surviving spouse is a U.S. citizen. If you are not a U.S. citizen, your spouse\u2019s estate cannot use the marital deduction unless a special trust, known as a Qualified Domestic Trust (QDOT), is established. In that case, assets placed in the QDOT can qualify for the marital deduction, although distributions may still be subject to estate tax.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-portability-and-the-deceased-spousal-unused-exclusion-dsue-nbsp\"><strong>Portability and the Deceased Spousal Unused Exclusion (DSUE)<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS allows surviving spouses to inherit any unused portion of their spouse\u2019s estate tax exemption through a rule called portability. The amount you can claim is called the Deceased Spousal Unused Exclusion (DSUE). &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-does-portability-work-nbsp\"><strong><em>How Does Portability Work?<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine your spouse passes away and their estate is worth less than the exemption amount, say, $8 million. Since the exemption is $13.99 million, your spouse hasn\u2019t used their entire exemption. They\u2019ve only used $8 million, so there\u2019s about $5.99 million left unused. Thanks to portability, you can add that unused $5.99 million to your own exemption when you eventually pass away. So instead of having just $13.99 million to pass tax-free, you\u2019d have about $19.98 million. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without portability, each spouse has their own separate exemption. In other words, unused exemption amounts would be lost when the first spouse dies. Portability preserves the unused exemption, allowing couples to effectively double their tax-free estate limit if planned correctly. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To take advantage of portability, your spouse\u2019s estate executor must file IRS Form 706 within nine months of death (with a possible six-month extension). Even if the estate owes no tax, filing this form is critical. If it\u2019s not filed, the unused exemption is lost, and you can\u2019t use it later.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-last-surviving-spouse-rule-nbsp\"><strong><em>The Last Surviving Spouse Rule<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s something many people don\u2019t know: you can only use the DSUE from your most recently deceased spouse. Let\u2019s say your first spouse dies, and you elect portability to carry over their unused exemption. Later, you remarry, and your second spouse also passes. At that point, you can only use the DSUE from the second spouse\u2014even if the first had a bigger unused amount. This is called the Last Surviving Spouse Rule, and it can have major implications if you remarry after being widowed. It\u2019s a key reason to consider long-term estate planning, especially if you plan to remarry. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, suppose Jane&#8217;s first husband, John, passed away, and she elected portability to use his unused exemption. If Jane later marries Mark and he also passes away, she can only use Mark&#8217;s DSUE, not John&#8217;s, even if Mark&#8217;s DSUE is less advantageous.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-state-estate-and-inheritance-taxes-nbsp\"><strong>State Estate and Inheritance Taxes<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While federal estate taxes may not apply to many estates, state-level <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/an-overview-of-estate-and-inheritance-taxes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">estate or inheritance taxes<\/a> can still impact widows. Several states impose their own estate taxes with exemption thresholds significantly lower than the federal level. For example, Oregon has estate tax exemptions of $1 million and tax rates ranging from 10% to 16%. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some states (Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania) also charge inheritance taxes, but most exempt surviving spouses. Inheritance taxes are different from estate taxes in that they are levied on the beneficiaries rather than the estate itself. For example, if you inherit $50,000 from a distant cousin in Pennsylvania, you may be subject to inheritance tax. But if your spouse dies and leaves you $1 million, you generally won\u2019t owe any inheritance tax in any state.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-special-circumstances-nbsp\"><strong>Special Circumstances<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, inheriting an estate can pose quite a few tricky scenarios. Here are just a few that are more common than you\u2019d think.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-joint-owned-property-nbsp\"><strong><em>Joint Owned Property<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When a couple owns something together, like a house or bank account, it usually goes straight to the surviving spouse when one person dies, without going through the court process called probate. That makes things easier and faster. But for estate tax purposes, the IRS may count the full value of that shared asset in the estate of the person who died. That is unless the surviving spouse can show they helped pay for it. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some things, like trusts, retirement accounts, or <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/do-widows-pay-taxes-on-life-insurance-payouts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">life insurance<\/a> with named beneficiaries, also avoid probate and go directly to the person listed. However, they can still be taxed as part of the estate depending on how they\u2019re set up. Using tools like trusts, especially special ones designed to protect the estate tax exemption, can help a family pay less in taxes when someone passes away. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-you-re-not-a-u-s-citizen-nbsp\"><strong><em>You\u2019re Not a U.S. Citizen<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We mentioned that the unlimited marital deduction only applies if the surviving spouse is a U.S. citizen. If you\u2019re not, you won\u2019t be able to inherit tax-free in the same way. But a Qualified Domestic Trust (QDOT) helps fix that. A QDOT lets the surviving spouse receive income from the trust over time, instead of inheriting everything at once. This delays (or defers) the estate tax until either: &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The trust gives out the main money (the principal), or&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The surviving spouse passes away.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Say John (a U.S. citizen) dies and leaves $5 million to his wife, Sofia (a non-citizen). Without a QDOT, Sofia would have to pay estate taxes right away. But with a QDOT:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The $5 million goes into the trust.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Sofia gets regular income from the trust (like interest or dividends).&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>No estate tax is due yet.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If she later takes out a chunk of the principal, estate tax is due on that amount.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>When she eventually dies, estate tax is paid on whatever is left in the <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/what-is-a-trust-fund-recovery-penalty\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">trust<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach allows the surviving spouse to benefit from the money while postponing estate taxes, which can help with financial stability.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-should-widows-do-now-nbsp\"><strong>What Should Widows Do Now?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re recently widowed, there are some important steps to take:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Start by figuring out the total value of your spouse\u2019s estate.<\/strong> This includes everything\u2014real estate, retirement accounts, bank accounts, business interests, and personal property.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Talk to a qualified estate attorney and a tax advisor. <\/strong>Even if you think the estate is small, they can help you understand your options and avoid missing critical deadlines like Form 706.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>If portability applies, don\u2019t skip Form 706. <\/strong>Filing this form is the only way to transfer your spouse\u2019s unused exemption to you, even if no tax is due now.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"4\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Review your own estate plan.<\/strong> Inheriting assets may significantly change your financial picture.

In order to protect yourself, it is vital to exercise caution and provide only the documents and information that are absolutely necessary. Below are a few scams to be aware of during tax time to help avoid becoming a fraudster\u2019s next victim.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Phone and Email Scams<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most obvious way to protect yourself against scammers is to never give out your personal information to someone you don\u2019t know, especially over the phone. If someone from the \u201cIRS\u201d is attempting to contact you over the phone or by email and asks for your social security or card information, don\u2019t give it to them. The IRS almost never contacts via phone, instead preferring to send notices via mail.\u00a0 Even if you do receive a call from the IRS, they won\u2019t ask for your social security number &#8211; they already have that information.\u00a0 If you feel uncomfortable about the validity of a call, hang up and call the IRS yourself &#8211; that way you know if what they\u2019re telling you is true.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Accountant fraud<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be wary of scammers who will pose as a tax preparer and then rip off customers through refund fraud or identity theft. These phony accountants will tell you that they can get you a large tax refund and typically prey on low-income and non-English speaking taxpayers.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you go to a legitimate tax preparer, your information can still be exposed if there is a data breach. To avoid this happening &#8211; and being left vulnerable &#8211; ask your tax preparer what more you can do to protect your information in case of a breach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Identity theft<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure to protect your social security number at all costs. Identity thieves will attempt to steal this information in order to steal not only your identity but your tax refund too. As long as you notify the IRS that your information has been compromised and your refund has been stolen, the IRS will work with you to provide your refund. However, it will take extensive time and paperwork to prove that your information was stolen.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Medical Identity Theft<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Financial fraud such as a stolen credit card can be frustrating but can be quickly resolved since it\u2019s easier to detect, and often doesn\u2019t have significant long-term financial impacts. Medical identity fraud, on the other hand, can cost a victim $13,500 on average and be notoriously difficult to resolve. Because of advancements in electronic communication and collaboration in the healthcare industry, personal health information (PHI) is more exposed and accessible. At the same time, this doesn\u2019t always mean that your health provider is on the same page with your insurer. PHI is rarely tracked across multiple networks and this gap can make stealing and using it feasible.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In conclusion&#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Tax Season is now upon us, and it\u2019s important to protect your personal information and ensure that it can\u2019t be compromised. Always be wary of phone calls or emails that you receive claiming to be from the IRS, especially when they\u2019re asking for your bank information or social security number. Also, do your research when looking for a tax preparer to file your taxes for you, and make sure they have their license, as well as positive reviews from previous clients. Lastly, make sure to monitor your social security number to ensure that your data has not been breached and your identity hasn\u2019t been stolen.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you need tax help, contact us for a free consultation.<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Affordable Tax Relief provides assistance to individuals struggling with unmanageable IRS tax burdens.

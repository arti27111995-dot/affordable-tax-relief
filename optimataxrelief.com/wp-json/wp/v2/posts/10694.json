They are levied by local governments and are a critical source of funding for public services such as schools, roads, and emergency services. Property taxes are paid on property owned, either by an individual or a legal entity.&nbsp;How much property tax you are required to pay is determined by the local government where the property is located.<\/span><\/span><\/span> Understanding how property taxes work and the rules regarding tax deductions can help property owners manage their finances more effectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-are-property-taxes-nbsp\"><strong>What Are Property Taxes?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Property taxes are a form of tax levied by local governments on <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/ask-phil-taxes-and-real-estate\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">real estate<\/a> properties, including both land and structures. These taxes are a primary source of revenue for municipalities, counties, and school districts, funding essential public services such as education, transportation, emergency services, and infrastructure maintenance. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-property-taxes-are-calculated-nbsp\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><strong>How Property Taxes Are Calculated<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Property taxes are typically calculated based on the assessed value of the property and the local tax rate, often expressed as a millage rate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-assessment-of-property-value-nbsp\"><strong><em>Assessment of Property Value<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The assessed value of a property is determined by a local tax assessor, who evaluates the property periodically. This assessment considers various factors, including the property\u2019s size, location, condition, and recent sales of similar properties in the area.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-millage-rates-nbsp\"><strong><em>Millage Rates<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A millage rate. Sometimes called a mill tax, is the amount per $1,000 of property value that is used to calculate local property taxes. For instance, a millage rate of 20 mills means that $20 in tax is levied for every $1,000 of assessed property value. The mill tax is multiplied by the property value to calculate your assessed value of your property. This&nbsp;is then used to find the fair market value of your property. This figure is multiplied by an assessment rate to calculate your tax bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your property tax bill may be higher or lower than your neighbor\u2019s. One&nbsp;example&nbsp;is&nbsp;if your plot of land is larger. Another is&nbsp;if your home\u2019s assessed value is higher.&nbsp;In some rare cases, your neighbor\u2019s property may fall in a different jurisdiction with a lower mill tax rate, resulting in a smaller tax bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-who-pays-property-taxes-nbsp-nbsp\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><strong>Who Pays Property Taxes?&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Typically, most owners of property must pay property taxes, whether they are an individual or legal entity. However, there are some groups or property types that are exempt. These include&nbsp;senior citizens, those with disabilities, and <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/tax-tips-for-veterans\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">military veterans<\/a>. Additionally, there is a homestead exemption that reduced property tax bills. The rules for exemption vary by state or municipality so it\u2019s best to check with your local and state government. Also note that the agencies that collect property taxes will not always notify you if you do qualify for an exemption and you may need to apply for it on your own.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-to-pay-property-taxes-nbsp\"><strong>How to Pay Property Taxes<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Property taxes are typically paid annually or semi-annually. Homeowners receive a bill from their local tax authority, detailing the amount owed and the due date. Many mortgage lenders require borrowers to set up an escrow account to cover property taxes and homeowners&#8217; insurance. Each month, the homeowner pays a portion of the estimated annual property tax and insurance costs into the escrow account. The lender then pays the tax bill on behalf of the homeowner when it is due. &nbsp;<span data-contrast=\"auto\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-if-i-don-t-pay-my-property-taxes-nbsp-nbsp\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><strong>What If I Don\u2019t Pay My Property Taxes?&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Put simply, failing to pay property taxes can result in a <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/ask-phil-tips-to-avoid-levies-liens\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">lien<\/a> on your&nbsp;home. A lien is a legal claim against your property that can be used as collateral to repay the debt owed. If you still do not pay off the balance, the taxing authority can legally sell your home, or sell the tax lien. In this case, the purchaser of the lien can have your home foreclosed or use other methods to obtain the deed to your property. The consequences vary by state.&nbsp;If you\u2019re struggling to pay your property taxes, some local governments offer payment plans or tax deferral programs. These programs can help spread out payments over time and avoid penalties.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-property-tax-deductions-nbsp\"><strong>Property Tax Deductions<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Property taxes can be a significant expense, but homeowners may be able to offset some of the cost through tax deductions. The <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/what-is-the-salt-deduction\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SALT deduction<\/a> allows taxpayers to deduct certain taxes paid to state and local governments, including property taxes, from their federal taxable income. You can deduct up to $10,000 per year ($5,000 for married individuals filing separately) in 2024. You can deduct up to $40,000 ($20,000 for married couples who file separately) in 2025. To claim the property tax deduction, homeowners must itemize their deductions on Schedule A of their federal income tax return. Itemizing is only beneficial if total itemized deductions exceed the standard deduction.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For rental properties and investment real estate, property taxes are considered a business expense and can be deducted from rental income. This deduction is not subject to the SALT cap. Homeowners who use part of their home for business purposes may be eligible for a home office deduction. However, only the portion used for business can be deducted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tax-relief-for-homeowners-nbsp\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Tax Relief for Homeowners<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It goes without saying that all property owners should stay on top of their property tax bills. Understanding how property taxes are assessed and the rules for tax deductions can help homeowners and real estate investors manage their tax burden more effectively.

With a team of experienced tax professionals, affordable Tax Relief specializes in negotiating with the IRS and state tax agencies to secure favorable outcomes for their clients. Understanding the services they provide and their approach to tax resolution can help taxpayers make informed decisions about seeking professional assistance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Understanding Tax Relief<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/blog\/how-tax-relief-works\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tax relief<\/a> refers to programs and strategies designed to help individuals and businesses manage or eliminate their tax debt. Taxpayers often find themselves in difficult financial situations due to unforeseen circumstances such as job loss, medical emergencies, or business downturns. When unpaid taxes accumulate, the IRS can take aggressive collection actions, making it crucial to seek assistance from professionals who understand the complexities of tax law.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some common tax issues that individuals face include failure to file tax returns, underpayment of taxes, and penalties resulting from late payments. The IRS can impose interest and penalties that significantly increase the total amount owed. In severe cases, taxpayers may face tax liens, levies, or even seizure of assets. affordable works to mitigate these consequences by negotiating solutions tailored to each client\u2019s unique financial situation.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>affordable Tax Relief\u2019s Process<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>affordable Tax Relief follows a structured two-phase process designed to thoroughly assess each client\u2019s tax situation and implement the most effective resolution strategy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Phase 1: Investigation<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first phase of the process involves gathering critical financial and tax-related information to understand the full scope of the client\u2019s tax issues. Tax professionals at affordable conduct a comprehensive review of the client\u2019s IRS transcripts, tax returns, and financial records. This step allows them to identify the best course of action based on the client\u2019s income, assets, and outstanding tax liabilities.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the investigation phase, affordable Tax Relief determines eligibility for various tax resolution programs, such as installment agreements, offers in compromise, or <a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/blog\/what-is-currently-not-collectible-status\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">currently not collectible status<\/a>. For example, if a taxpayer owes $25,000 in back taxes but has a limited ability to pay due to medical expenses, affordable may explore options for reducing the debt through an offer in compromise. The goal of this phase is to provide the client with a clear understanding of their tax situation and the available options for resolution.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Phase 2: Resolution<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the investigation is complete, the resolution phase begins. This involves direct negotiations with the IRS or state tax agencies to implement the most suitable solution for the client. affordable Tax Relief\u2019s team of tax professionals, which includes attorneys, CPAs, and enrolled agents, work on behalf of the client to secure the best possible outcome.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a taxpayer is unable to pay their full tax debt upfront, affordable may negotiate an installment agreement that allows them to make manageable monthly payments. In cases where the taxpayer qualifies for an offer in compromise, affordable presents a settlement offer to the IRS, which could significantly reduce the amount owed. For clients facing immediate collection actions, such as wage garnishments or bank levies, affordable takes swift action to halt these measures and negotiate alternative solutions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Services Offered by affordable Tax Relief<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>affordable Tax Relief provides a wide range of services to address various tax challenges. Each service is designed to help taxpayers regain financial stability and prevent future tax issues.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Tax Consultation &amp; Investigation<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before initiating any tax resolution plan, affordable Tax Relief conducts an in-depth consultation to assess the client\u2019s situation. This process involves gathering tax documents, reviewing financial records, and identifying potential resolution strategies. By conducting a thorough investigation, affordable ensures that clients receive accurate recommendations tailored to their financial circumstances.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>IRS &amp; State Tax Resolution<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For individuals who owe back taxes, affordable Tax Relief provides assistance in negotiating with both the IRS and state tax agencies. This includes setting up installment agreements that allow taxpayers to pay off their debt over time, applying for <a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/blog\/what-is-irs-penalty-abatement\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">penalty abatement<\/a> to reduce accrued penalties, and seeking tax debt forgiveness through an offer in compromise.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a self-employed contractor who fell behind on estimated tax payments and accrued $50,000 in tax debt may struggle to pay off the full amount. affordable Tax Relief can negotiate an installment agreement that allows them to make affordable monthly payments while avoiding further penalties.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Tax Preparation &amp; Compliance<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To access certain resolution options, such as an installment agreement or offer in compromise, you may need to bring your tax filings up to date. affordable Tax Relief helps clients achieve compliance by filing missing tax returns and working toward a resolution that meets IRS requirements.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Filing accurate and timely tax returns is essential for avoiding additional penalties and interest charges. By working with tax professionals, individuals can ensure that their tax returns are prepared correctly and that they take advantage of all available deductions and credits.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Wage Garnishment &amp; Levy Release<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When the IRS enforces collection actions such as wage garnishments or bank levies, taxpayers may find themselves unable to cover essential living expenses. affordable Tax Relief works quickly to stop wage garnishments and release levies by negotiating alternative payment solutions. If a taxpayer receives notice that their wages will be garnished due to unpaid taxes, affordable can intervene by proving financial hardship or arranging a payment plan that satisfies the IRS while allowing the taxpayer to retain a portion of their income.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Tax Lien Assistance<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A tax lien is a legal claim by the IRS against a taxpayer\u2019s property due to unpaid tax debt. Tax liens can severely impact credit scores and financial stability. affordable Tax Relief helps clients resolve tax liens by negotiating payment plans or securing <a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/blog\/how-to-apply-for-a-withdrawal-of-notice-of-federal-tax-lien\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tax lien withdrawals<\/a> when appropriate. If a homeowner has a tax lien placed on their property, affordable may work with the IRS to have the lien removed, allowing the individual to sell or refinance their home without complications.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>affordable Tax Shield<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to tax resolution services, affordable offers affordable Tax Shield, a proactive program designed to help individuals stay compliant with their taxes and avoid future tax problems.

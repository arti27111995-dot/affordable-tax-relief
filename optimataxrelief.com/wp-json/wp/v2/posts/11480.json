This is part of the broader State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction and allows you to deduct either state and local sales tax or income tax paid during the year from your federal taxable income. By reducing your taxable income, you could potentially lower your overall federal tax liability. With the passage of President Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill in 2025, important changes to the SALT deduction cap have taken effect, making this benefit more valuable for some taxpayers.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-sales-tax-vs-income-tax-nbsp\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Sales Tax vs. Income Tax<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">When claiming the SALT deduction, you must choose between deducting state and local sales tax or state and local income tax.

Thanks to the 2025 One Big Beautiful Bill, many households will enjoy a higher SALT deduction cap for the next several years, with inflation indexing and new phaseout rules based on income. <\/span>Still, the choice between sales tax and income tax deductions requires careful consideration. Your residency, recent spending, income levels, and tax filing status all play a role. As always, consult a trusted tax professional or use IRS tools to ensure you&#8217;re maximizing your deduction and complying with current tax law.

This marks a crucial phase in the aftermath of the global economic challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. This decision has implications for taxpayers across the United States, as the IRS seeks to address the mounting financial pressures faced by the government. However, the IRS is providing penalty relief to nearly 5 million taxpayers. In this article, we\u2019ll discuss the details of IRS collections in 2024 and tax relief options available for those with tough tax situations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Background<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The temporary halt on IRS collections was initiated in February 2022 as a response to the economic downturn caused by the pandemic. It provided relief to countless individuals and businesses struggling to meet their tax obligations. The suspension aimed to alleviate immediate financial burdens and stimulate economic recovery. Although taxpayers should note that the failure-to-pay penalty continues to accrue during nonpayment. However, as the nation slowly recovers, the IRS has deemed it necessary to reinstate collections to ensure the sustained functioning of essential government services.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Key Changes in IRS Collections<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS will send out collection notices again beginning in January 2024. The IRS is focusing on taxpayers with taxes bills for tax years before 2022. They will also send notices to businesses, tax-exempt organizations, trusts, and estates with tax bills from before 2023. The specific <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/i-received-an-irs-notice-now-what\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">IRS notice<\/a> being sent out will be IRS LT38, which is a notice of resumption. Taxpayers who receive this letter should contact the IRS about payments or other options available to them. If action is not taken, the next notice they receive will involve more serious action leading to IRS collections. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As collections resume, the IRS will also ramp up its enforcement efforts to address outstanding tax debts. This may involve increased audits, investigations, and legal actions against non-compliant taxpayers. It is crucial for individuals and businesses to ensure compliance with tax obligations to avoid potential legal consequences.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>IRS Penalty Relief<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To ease the new collections process, the IRS is offering penalty relief to nearly 5 million taxpayers, including businesses and tax-exempt organizations. The IRS did not send these taxpayers automated notices during the pandemic. The relief will come in the form of waivers for <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog-what-you-need-to-know-about-underpayment-of-tax-penalties\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">failure-to-pay penalties<\/a>, adding up to $1 billion. Eligible taxpayers will automatically receive penalty abatement in their online accounts with no further action needed. If the taxpayer already paid their penalties for tax years 2020 and 2021, they would receive a refund. Alternatively, the IRS may credit the payment towards another tax bill. Refunds and credits will be sent out beginning in January 2024. More information can be found in IRS Notice 2024-7 on their website. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be eligible for penalty relief, taxpayers must have a tax balance of less than $100,000 for each return and each entity. They also must have received an initial balance due notice between February 5, 2022, and December 7, 2023. The IRS will resume the failure-to-pay penalty for eligible taxpayers on April 1, 2024.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Preparing for IRS Collections Resumption<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the IRS gears up to resume collections, taxpayers are encouraged to take proactive steps to manage their tax liabilities effectively:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"1\">\n<li><strong>Review Financial Situation:<\/strong> Assess your current financial situation and evaluate your ability to meet tax obligations. Understanding your financial standing will help you make informed decisions and explore available options.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Explore Payment Plans:<\/strong> Investigate <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/how-irs-installment-agreements-work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">installment plans<\/a> and other payment options offered by the IRS. Engage with the agency to negotiate a plan that aligns with your financial capacity.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Seek Professional Guidance:<\/strong> Consult with tax professionals or financial advisors to navigate the complexities of tax obligations. They can provide valuable insights into available options and help you make informed decisions.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Stay Informed: <\/strong>Stay updated on IRS communications and guidelines regarding the resumption of collections. The IRS website and official announcements will be valuable sources of information during this period.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>More Relief Options for Taxpayers Who Owe<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS resuming collections in 2024 marks a pivotal moment for taxpayers in the United States. While it signifies a return to normalcy for government revenue collection, the penalty relief demonstrates a commitment to supporting individuals and businesses still recovering from the economic impact of the pandemic. By staying informed and proactively managing their tax obligations, taxpayers can navigate the challenges posed by the resumption of collections and work towards financial stability.

Depending on the notice that you receive from the IRS, it can cause anxiety and fear, and you may even feel unsure about what your next move will be or what tax solutions may be available to you. The IRS does have tools available that taxpayers can utilize for IRS tax help, even if they received a notice that makes it unclear what their next steps would be. Below are some of the most common collection notices sent out to taxpayers every year.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CP501\/502<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve received a CP501 notice, it means that the IRS is attempting to notify you of a past balance due. The IRS will request that you take action in order to resolve your outstanding balance. A CP502 notice also doubles as a reminder that the IRS sends about your tax balance. Typically, each notice indicates the interest and penalties that have accrued in addition to what you owe to the IRS.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you receive these types of notices, the IRS is letting you know of what the current balance, including interest and penalties, is owed. Once you confirm that the balance is accurate, you can either pay the balance for the tax year in question or contact the IRS to get set up on a payment plan.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CP504<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A CP504 notice is a secondary notice that the IRS will send to alert you of your tax debt if you owe a tax balance. This notice is to also notify you that they\u2019re preparing to start collection action and to seize any tax refund you may have received. The IRS will continue their collection action against a taxpayer until their balance is paid in full.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To avoid the IRS sending you into collections, it is important to stay compliant. You can do this by paying off your balance in full with the IRS or asking to be placed on a payment plan. It is also paramount that you continue to monitor your mail to ensure that you don\u2019t receive any further notices from the IRS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>LT11\/CP90<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An LT11 is a notice to remind a taxpayer that they have an overdue payment for overdue taxes. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS will send a CP90 notice if they have attempted to reach out to a taxpayer multiple times about their tax balance and have yet to receive a response. The letter states that the IRS has the intent to seize a taxpayer\u2019s property or rights to their property if they fail to resolve their outstanding balance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both these notices are a warning that the IRS will begin to take collection action against the taxpayer and it is up to the taxpayer to either continue to stay in collections with the IRS or settle their debt and get compliant. At this point in time, it is vital that you attempt to rectify the situation and get help with IRS debt by contacting them immediately to resolve your liability in addition to any interest and penalties that you have accrued.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of what notice you have received, it is important to review the notice and resolve the situation if needed. The IRS typically sends written communication to taxpayers to notify them of their tax balance and to reconcile their liability as soon as possible. If you need tax help and don\u2019t know the first step to resolving your balance with the IRS, a tax relief company may be your best bet. A tax relief company will work with the IRS on your behalf to address your tax issues so you can be compliant moving forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> affordable Tax Relief provides assistance to individuals struggling with unmanageable IRS tax burdens.

They are particularly common in the realm of technology and startups. ESOs represent a unique opportunity for employees to share in the success of the company they work for. They allow employees to potentially reap significant financial rewards as the company grows. However, amidst the allure of potential wealth, a critical question looms: Are employee stock options considered income?\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Are Employee Stock Options?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Employee stock options (ESOs) are a form of compensation commonly offered by companies to their employees. They grant employees the right to purchase a specified number of shares of company stock at a predetermined price within a designated period of time. This price is known as the exercise or strike price.  These options typically vest over time. This basically mean that employees become eligible to exercise them in increments as they fulfill certain conditions. These can include remaining with the company for a certain number of years. When discussing ESOs, there are two main types that are often seen. These are incentive stock options (ISOs) and non-qualified stock options (NSOs). You may also hear about restricted stock units (RSUs). However, RSUs are technically not options and therefore, do not need to be exercised.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Incentive Stock Options (ISOs)<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ISOs are typically offered to employees as part of a qualified stock option plan. They are subject to specific rules outlined by the IRS. If certain requirements are met, the gains from ISOs may qualify for favorable tax treatment. This is important because it could mean it is taxed at the lower capital gains rate rather than the ordinary income tax rate.\u00a0One example is holding the stock for a specified period after exercise,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>How Are Incentive Stock Options Taxed?<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When ISOs are granted to an employee, there are no tax implications. The employee does not recognize income at this stage. When an employee exercises their ISOs by purchasing the underlying stock at the exercise price, no taxes are owed. However, the spread between the exercise price and the fair market value of the stock on the date of exercise (known as the &#8220;bargain element&#8221;) may be subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) in the year of exercise. Once you exercise an ISO, your employer must file Form 3921, Exercise of an Incentive Stock option plan under Section 422(b). Further, you may receive Form 3922, Transfer of Stock Acquired Through an Employee Stock Purchase Plan. This form helps determine your gain or loss, plus whether it is capital or ordinary income.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>How to Minimize Taxes on ISOs<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To qualify for favorable tax treatment, the employee must hold the shares acquired through the exercise of ISOs for a certain period of time. This timeline begins at least two years from the date of grant and one year from the date of exercise. If these holding period requirements are met, any gain or loss from the sale of the stock is treated as a capital gain or loss for regular income tax purposes.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the shares acquired through the exercise of ISOs are sold, the employee may be subject to either short-term or long-term capital gains tax. Which one depends on the holding period. If the shares are held for more than one year after exercise and two years from the date of grant, any gain is typically treated as a long-term capital gain. That said, it will be taxed at the applicable long-term capital gains tax rate. This is important because it is generally lower than the ordinary income tax rate.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Non-Qualified Stock Options (NSOs)<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>NSOs, also known as non-statutory stock options, do not qualify for the same tax treatment as ISOs. They are more flexible for companies to offer, as they are not subject to the same strict IRS regulations. However, NSOs are subject to ordinary income tax. The tax is on the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the stock at the time of exercise.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>How Are Non-Qualified Stock Options Taxed?<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Like ISOs, there are no tax implications when NSOs are granted to an employee. When an employee exercises their NSOs by purchasing the underlying stock at the exercise price, the spread between the fair market value of the stock on the exercise date and the exercise price is considered ordinary income for tax purposes. This amount is typically subject to federal income tax, as well as FICA taxes. It may be subject to state and local income taxes as well. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em><strong>How to Minimize Taxes on NSOs<\/strong>\u00a0<\/em><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After exercising NSOs, employees may choose to hold onto the acquired shares or sell them. Any subsequent gain or loss upon the sale of the stock is treated as a capital gain or loss. If the shares are held for more than one year after exercise, any gain is typically treated as a long-term capital gain. Therefore, it is taxed at the long-term capital gains tax rate. As mentioned, this is generally lower than the ordinary income tax rate. If the shares are sold before one year from the exercise date, any gain is typically treated as a short-term capital gain. Short-term capital gains are taxed at the ordinary income tax rate.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>NSOs do not trigger the same AMT implications as ISOs upon exercise. However, the income recognized upon exercise may still impact an employee&#8217;s AMT calculation for the year. Employers are usually required to withhold taxes on the ordinary income recognized upon the exercise of NSOs. The amount withheld is based on the fair market value of the stock on the exercise date and the employee&#8217;s ordinary income tax rate.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tax Help for Employee Stockholders<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, employee stock options are generally considered a form of compensation and subject to taxation. However, the timing and method of taxation can vary depending on the type of options granted and the specific circumstances. It&#8217;s essential for employees to seek guidance to ensure they fully understand the implications of their stock options. This will also allow them to make informed decisions regarding their exercise and taxation.

There are three primary types of IRS audits:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Correspondence Audits:<\/strong>\u00a0These are the most common and least intrusive type of IRS audit. In a correspondence audit, the IRS requests specific documentation to support claims on their tax return. Typically, these audits are focused on one or a few specific issues, such as income, deductions, or credits. Taxpayers can respond to these audits by mail, providing the requested documentation and explanations.\u00a0<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Office Audits:<\/strong>\u00a0An office audit, as the name suggests, takes place at an IRS office or a local IRS branch office. The IRS will contact the taxpayer to schedule a face-to-face appointment for the audit. The taxpayer will be required to bring the necessary records and documentation to the IRS office. Office audits are often more comprehensive than correspondence audits as they can cover a wider range of issues on a tax return.\u00a0<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Field Audits:\u00a0<\/strong>Field audits are the most extensive and thorough type of IRS audit. In a field audit, an IRS agent comes to the taxpayer\u2019s home or business to conduct the audit in person. These audits are usually reserved for more complex or high-risk cases. That said, they can involve a comprehensive review of a taxpayer\u2019s financial records and activities. Field audits are often conducted when there are significant discrepancies or concerns about a taxpayer\u2019s compliance with tax laws. However, note that the IRS has halted most unannounced visits to taxpayers.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Reporting a Business Loss&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS will be more inclined to audit a taxpayer who reports a net business loss, even if it&#8217;s small. Reporting losses year after year will only increase IRS interest in your tax returns. Remember, it is mandatory to report all earnings in a tax year. However, it might be helpful to reconsider which expenses should be deducted from your tax return. Reporting even a small profit could reduce the chance of being audited by the IRS.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Being Vague About Expenses<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to expenses, the more detail the better. This is especially true when categorizing them on your return. Try to avoid listing expenses under \u201cOther Expenses\u201d as this will lead to more scrutiny from the IRS. It may even be helpful to provide supplemental documentation explaining why certain expenses drastically increased or decreased for that year. Doing so can give potential auditors&nbsp;a&nbsp;valid explanation for such occurrences and possibly avoid a tax audit. Additionally, rounding dollar amounts are red flags for the IRS. You should always use exact dollar amounts on your tax return.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Filing Late<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some taxpayers believe that filing late can actually decrease the risk of being audited. However, filing on time, as well as paying on time, can help establish a history of IRS compliance. This will be far more beneficial in the long run.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition,&nbsp;not filing by the&nbsp;due date&nbsp;will also result in receiving your tax refund later if you are expecting one. Even worse, if your late filing triggers an audit, it may prompt the IRS to look at older tax returns&nbsp;you\u2019ve&nbsp;filed. If they find any other&nbsp;errors, this can&nbsp;add&nbsp;additional&nbsp;time to their normal processing schedule.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Claiming Excessive Deductions<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is best to avoid any excessive expenses. For example, deducting the cost of your breakfast and lunch each workday may not be acceptable to the IRS. Excessive deductions for your donations to charitable organizations can also increase the chances of being audited. Inflating business expenses can result in being audited, especially if you try to claim large amounts for business entertainment or claim a vehicle that is used for only business purposes 100 percent of the time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that home offices are more common, it\u2019s important to only claim the home office deduction for the portion of your home that is used exclusively for business purposes. When claiming this deduction, you will need to figure out how much square footage in your home is dedicated to your business. For tax year 2023, the rate for the simplified square footage calculation is $5 per square foot, with a maximum of 300 square feet or $1,500.&nbsp;Excessive deductions claimed on your return are fast tracks to being audited by the IRS.&nbsp;That said, it\u2019s best to only claim the deductions you actually qualify for to avoid owing any additional taxes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Keeping Poor Records<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the simplest tax situations require adequate records. If your finances are more complicated, then detailed records are necessary. Some taxpayers may feel inclined to estimate their expenses because they did not save receipts or documents, which the IRS views as a red flag. It\u2019s important to make sure you have detailed records for the past three tax years at minimum. Having items like your previous tax returns, medical bills, business receipts, real estate documents, and investment statements can help substantiate your claims and avoid an IRS audit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Choosing the Wrong Filing Status<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your filing status (single, married filing jointly, married filing separately or head of household) determines how you treat many tax decisions, such as what forms you\u2019ll fill out, which deductions and credits you\u2019ll take and how much you will pay (or save) in taxes. Select the wrong status, and it will trigger a cascade of mistakes\u2013maybe even an audit. On top of that, if you decide to file jointly with your spouse, this means you\u2019re responsible for any errors or deliberate falsehoods on your partner\u2019s return, so make sure that you\u2019re comfortable with what it says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tax Relief for Those Being Audited<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The chances of being audited are low, but those chances increase when the IRS notices any of the above red flags. The audit process can be very stressful. It is a tedious process that requires collecting information regarding your income, expenses, and itemized deductions. Failing an audit can result in a huge, unexpected tax bill. It\u2019s best to seek assistance from experts who can help you avoid an IRS audit.&nbsp;Remember, filing your taxes correctly the first time can help avoid interest,&nbsp;tax&nbsp;penalties, and&nbsp;additional&nbsp;taxes owed.&nbsp;Optima Tax Relief is the nation\u2019s leading tax resolution firm with over $1 billion in resolved tax liabilities.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If You Need Tax Help, Contact Us Today for a&nbsp;<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/app.optimataxrelief.com\/tax-problems\/?t=99&amp;utm_source=otr-blog-post&amp;utm_campaign=blog-cta&amp;adgroup=free-consultation&amp;network=otr-blogl&amp;ad=10-24-2023\"><strong>Free Consultation<\/strong><\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While there is no guaranteed method of avoiding\u00a0tax\u00a0audits, there are things\u00a0that could help trigger\u00a0them.\u00a0Since the\u00a0Senate\u00a0approved\u00a0nearly\u00a0$80 billion\u00a0in IRS funding\u00a0through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, with\u00a0$45.6 billion\u00a0specifically\u00a0for enforcement,\u00a0the IRS has promised an increase\u00a0in tax audits. \u00a0Below\u00a0are some things that the IRS has historically viewed as \u201cred flags,\u201d which could increase the chances of an audit for [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"off","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[48],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-12484","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-irs-collections"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v25.7.1 (Yoast SEO v25.7) -

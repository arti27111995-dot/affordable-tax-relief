Operating under the Department of the Treasury, the IRS plays a vital role in collecting taxes, processing tax returns, issuing refunds, and ensuring compliance with tax obligations. Understanding how the IRS functions is essential for both individuals and businesses to navigate the complexities of the U.S. tax system effectively.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>History of the IRS<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The roots of the IRS trace back to the Civil War era when President Abraham Lincoln and Congress established the Office of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in 1862 to fund the war through income taxes. Although the original income tax was repealed a decade later, the need for a consistent revenue source led to the ratification of the 16th Amendment in 1913. This amendment granted Congress the authority to levy an income tax without apportioning it among the states, paving the way for the modern IRS.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, the IRS has evolved significantly. The introduction of electronic filing (e-filing) in 1986 revolutionized how taxpayers submitted returns. By the early 2000s, millions of Americans were filing electronically, streamlining the process and reducing errors. Another notable milestone was the 1998 IRS Restructuring and Reform Act, which aimed to improve customer service and protect taxpayer rights.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Primary Functions of the IRS<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS\u2019s primary functions involve tax collection and enforcement, tax return and <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/whats-the-fastest-way-to-get-my-tax-refund\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">refund<\/a> processing, taxpayer assistance and resources, and administering tax credits and benefits.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Tax Collection and Enforcement<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the IRS&#8217;s core responsibilities is collecting taxes from individuals and businesses. Federal taxes include income tax, corporate tax, employment tax, and excise tax. When taxpayers fail to meet their obligations, the IRS has various enforcement tools at its disposal. These range from issuing notices and imposing penalties to levying wages or seizing assets. For example, if an individual owes $15,000 in unpaid taxes, the IRS may garnish wages or place a lien on property to recover the debt.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Tax Return Processing and Refunds<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Each year, the IRS processes over 150 million individual tax returns. During the tax season, millions of taxpayers file by the April deadline, with many anticipating refunds. The IRS uses sophisticated systems to verify information, calculate refunds, and detect discrepancies. For instance, if someone claims the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), the IRS may hold the refund until mid-February to prevent fraud. In 2023, the average refund was approximately $3,000, highlighting the importance of accurate filing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Providing Taxpayer Assistance and Resources<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS offers a range of services to help taxpayers understand and fulfill their tax responsibilities. These include online tools, telephone assistance, and in-person help at local <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/what-is-a-taxpayer-assistance-center\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Taxpayer Assistance Centers (TACs)<\/a>. Resources such as the &#8220;Where\u2019s My Refund?&#8221; tool and IRS Free File program provide convenient options for managing tax matters. For example, a taxpayer unsure about their filing status can use the Interactive Tax Assistant (ITA) to get personalized guidance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Administering Tax Credits and Benefits<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond collecting taxes, the IRS administers various credits and benefits designed to support taxpayers. These include the Child Tax Credit (CTC), EITC, and American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC). During the COVID-19 pandemic, the IRS also distributed Economic Impact Payments (stimulus checks) and managed advanced Child Tax Credit payments. These initiatives underscore the IRS\u2019s role in delivering financial relief during critical times.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Structure of the IRS<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding how the IRS is structured is key to understanding how the agency works as a whole.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Overview of Leadership and Divisions<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS is led by a Commissioner appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The Commissioner oversees the agency&#8217;s operations, ensuring compliance with tax laws and effective service delivery. Under the Commissioner, the IRS is divided into several major divisions catering to different taxpayer segments.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Key Departments and Their Roles<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wage and Investment Division handles services for individual taxpayers, managing the majority of tax returns filed. The Small Business\/Self-Employed Division focuses on compliance and assistance for <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/tax-deductions-for-small-businesses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">small businesses<\/a> and self-employed individuals. The Large Business and International Division addresses tax matters for multinational corporations and large partnerships. Additionally, the Criminal Investigation Division investigates tax fraud and other financial crimes. In 2022, for example, the division successfully prosecuted numerous cases involving fraudulent refund schemes and offshore tax evasion.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How the IRS Affects Taxpayers<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people encounter the IRS during tax season when filing returns or receiving refunds. Businesses interact more frequently, especially when dealing with payroll taxes, quarterly estimated payments, and compliance checks. For example, a small business owner must remit employment taxes on behalf of employees and may face penalties for missed deadlines.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Common IRS Communications<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS communicates primarily through mail, issuing letters and notices regarding tax matters. Notices may inform taxpayers of balances due, adjustments to returns, or audit notifications. Suppose someone receives a CP2000 notice, which indicates discrepancies between reported income and third-party data. In that case, responding promptly with supporting documents can resolve the issue without further action.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Importance of Compliance and Recordkeeping<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Compliance with tax laws is crucial to avoid penalties, interest, and legal action. Maintaining accurate records of income, expenses, and deductions simplifies the filing process and supports claims in case of an audit. For instance, retaining receipts for charitable donations ensures you can substantiate deductions if questioned by the IRS.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>IRS Tools and Resources<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, the IRS has worked to improve IRS tools and resources available to taxpayers. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>IRS Online Account Services<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS has expanded digital services to enhance taxpayer convenience. With an IRS Online Account, individuals can view tax balances, make payments, and access past tax records. For example, someone needing a transcript to apply for a mortgage can download it instantly, saving time compared to traditional mail requests.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/877301402\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">[Insert Ask Phil: IRS Online Account]<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS)<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The TAS is an independent organization within the IRS dedicated to assisting taxpayers facing unresolved issues or financial hardship. If you\u2019re experiencing delays or difficulty navigating the system, the TAS can intervene and work to resolve the matter. In one case, a taxpayer waiting months for a refund received assistance through the TAS, resulting in expedited processing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Educational Resources and Publications<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS provides a wealth of information through its website, including publications, tax guides, and instructional videos. Topics range from basic filing instructions to complex tax scenarios. For example, Publication 17 offers a comprehensive overview of individual tax filing requirements, while Publication 463 covers travel, gift, and car expenses for businesses.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The IRS Under the Trump Administration<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the Trump administration, the IRS faces significant budget constraints, leading to staff reductions and an overall diminished capacity to handle the growing complexities of the U.S. tax system. Senate Finance Committee Democrats have raised concerns about how these cuts could impact taxpayers. They\u2019ve warned that IRS staffing reductions would result in delays in processing tax refunds, potentially prolonged wait times on the IRS helpline, and generally degraded taxpayer services. As the IRS struggles to manage these challenges, the agency faces difficulties in handling returns, auditing, and assisting taxpayers with issues such as tax compliance and refunds.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For taxpayers, these issues could lead to frustration, especially for those who rely on timely refunds or need assistance navigating tax complexities. <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/my-tax-refund-is-late-now-what\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Delays in refunds<\/a> could negatively impact individuals and businesses that depend on those funds, while long wait times or poor service might leave many unable to resolve issues efficiently.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Trust Affordable Tax Relief for Help with the IRS<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Optima Tax Relief, we understand how frustrating IRS delays and poor service can be, especially when you\u2019re waiting for your tax refund or trying to resolve complex issues.

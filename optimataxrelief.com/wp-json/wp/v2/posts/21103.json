When these delays occur, taxpayers might wonder if they&#8217;re entitled to interest on their refund. The IRS does pay interest on tax refunds under specific circumstances. However, the rules governing when and how much interest is paid can be complex.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Understanding the Basics of Delayed Refunds<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Interest on tax refunds is designed to compensate taxpayers for the time they are without the money they are owed. However, the IRS doesn\u2019t start paying interest the moment your\u00a0refund is delayed. There are specific timelines and conditions under which interest is paid. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Filing Deadline and Interest Start Date<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For most taxpayers, the IRS must issue the refund within 45 days after the tax return is due, or the date the return was filed, whichever is later. E-filing is the <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/whats-the-fastest-way-to-get-my-tax-refund\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">fastest way to receive your tax refund<\/a>, as it speeds up the processing time compared to paper filing. If the IRS issues the refund after this 45-day window, it must pay interest on the refund. For example, if you filed your tax return by the typical deadline of April 15, the IRS has until May 30 to issue your refund without paying interest. If your refund is issued after May 30, interest will be added. If you file your tax return late, say on June 1, the IRS has until July 16 (45 days from June 1) to issue your refund without paying interest.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Amended Returns<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you file an\u00a0amended return\u00a0that results in an additional refund, the IRS typically has 45 days from the date the amended return is filed to issue the refund without paying interest. If the IRS takes longer than 45 days, interest will be paid on the additional refund amount. Imagine you filed your tax return on time, but later realized you missed a significant deduction. You file an amended return on August 1, resulting in an additional refund of $1,000. The IRS has until September 15 (45 days from August 1) to issue this additional refund.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Delays Caused by IRS Errors<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your refund is delayed due to an IRS error, and they correct the issue and issue a refund after the 45-day period, interest is paid from the original filing deadline or the date the return was filed (whichever is later) until the refund is issued.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Interest Rates on Refunds<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The interest rate the IRS pays on delayed refunds is tied to the federal short-term interest rate, plus 3 percentage points. As of <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/irs-announces-interest-rates-for-q2-of-2025\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Q2 of 2025<\/a>, the interest rate for overpayments of tax is 7% per year, compounded daily.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><th>Quarter (2025)\u00a0<\/th><th>IRS Interest<strong> Rate on Overpayments<\/strong><\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Q1 (January to March)&nbsp;<\/td><td>7%&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Q2 (April to June)&nbsp;<\/td><td>7%&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Q3 (July to September)&nbsp;<\/td><td>TBD&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Q4 (October to December)&nbsp;<\/td><td>TBD&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The overpayment rate for corporate refunds is 6% for Q1 and Q2&nbsp;of 2025. IRS interest rates are adjusted quarterly and can vary depending on when the refund is issued. Importantly, interest paid to you by the IRS is considered taxable income. That said, you\u2019ll need to report it on your next tax return.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Exceptions to Interest Payments<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some situations where the IRS may not be required to pay interest on delayed refunds:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Math Errors<\/strong>. If your tax return contains math errors or other discrepancies, the IRS may delay processing while it reviews your return. During this period, no interest is accrued.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Injured Spouse Claims.<\/strong> If you file an\u00a0injured spouse\u00a0claim, your refund may be delayed while the IRS processes the claim. Interest on the delayed portion may or may not be paid, depending on how long the delay lasts and when the claim is resolved.\u00a0\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Fraud or Identity Theft Investigations. <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/what-to-do-if-your-tax-refund-is-stolen\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Refunds delayed due to fraud or identity theft<\/a> investigations typically do not accrue interest during the investigation period.\u00a0\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tracking Your IRS Refund and Interest Payments<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS automatically tracks the interest owed on delayed refunds, so you don\u2019t need to bill them. However, if you want to stay updated on your refund status, there are two key ways to monitor it. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Use the IRS Refund Tracker. <\/strong>You can check the status of your federal refund online 24 hours after e-filing or four weeks after mailing a paper return. The IRS updates this information daily, showing whether your return has been received, approved, or sent.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Call the IRS for an Update.\u00a0<\/strong>If it&#8217;s been three weeks since you e-filed or six weeks since you mailed your return, you can contact the IRS by phone. \u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you believe the IRS has underpaid the interest on your delayed refund, you can seek assistance from the IRS <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/do-tax-advocates-really-help\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Taxpayer Advocate<\/a> Service by calling 877-777-4778 or visiting a local IRS office.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tax Help for Those Waiting on a Tax Refund<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, the IRS does pay interest on tax refunds, but only under specific conditions. Generally, if the IRS takes longer than 45 days after the filing deadline or the date you filed your return, whichever is later, to issue your refund, you\u2019ll receive interest on the amount owed. However, exceptions exist, and the exact timing and rate of interest depend on various factors. As always, if you have questions or concerns about a delayed refund, it\u2019s a good idea to consult with a tax professional or reach out to the IRS directly for clarification.

However, there are some tax documents that come in a bit later. For example, 1099-B and 1099-MISC are due to recipients by February 15. 1095 health coverage forms are due by March 1. Be sure to wait for all your documents to arrive before filing your tax return. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tax Tip #4: Don&#8217;t Forget About Estimated Tax Payments<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a small business owner, investor, landlord, or any taxpayer who receives income outside your normal job, you might need to pay estimated quarterly taxes. The 2024 quarterly tax payment deadlines are April 15, June 15, September 15, and January 15, 2025. Knowing these deadlines can help avoid tax penalties. You can use Form 1040-ES to calculate your estimated tax for the year.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tax Tip #3: Don\u2019t Wait on Your Tax Refund<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, it takes about 21 days to receive your tax refund. However, some returns may take more time to review than others. That said, it\u2019s best to not rely on your tax refund to make a big purchase or cover large expenses. You can use the online Where\u2019s My Refund tool on the IRS\u2019s website to track your refund status within 24 hours after e-filing and within 4 weeks of mailing a paper return.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tax Tip #2: Report 1099-K Income \u2013 Even If You Don\u2019t Receive the Form<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you receive payments on Venmo, PayPal, Etsy, eBay, or other third-party sites for your business, you probably know what a 1099-K is. The <a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/irs-announces-delay-in-1099-k-reporting\/\">1099-K reporting thresholds<\/a> have changed quite a bit in the last couple of years, making the topic confusing for many small businesses. In short, if you receive income from these third-party payment networks, you must report it on your tax return, even if you do not receive a 1099-K form. This income is still considered taxable income, which means not reporting it can result in\u00a0taxes owed to the IRS.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tax Tip #1: Create an IRS Online Account<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS Online Account allows taxpayers to access various services and information related to their tax obligations. Taxpayers can access their tax return transcripts, make payments, access IRS notices and letters, apply for installment agreements, view payment histories, and more. Put simply, it helps you know where you stand with the IRS.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join us next Friday as Phil will answer your questions about FinCEN!\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you need help with your taxes in 2024,&nbsp;contact us today&nbsp;for a <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/app.affordabletaxrelief.com\/tax-problems\/?t=99&amp;utm_source=otr-blog-post&amp;utm_campaign=blog-cta&amp;adgroup=free-consultation&amp;network=otr-blogl&amp;ad=02-09-2024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Free Consultation<\/strong><\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today, Phil discusses his top 5 tax tips for 2024.\u00a0\u00a0 Tax Tip #5: Gather Your Tax Documents Early&nbsp; Most tax forms, including your W-2s and most 1099s, should be sent to you by January 31.

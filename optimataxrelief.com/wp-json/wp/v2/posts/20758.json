This program is intended for individuals who cannot pay their full tax liability or doing so would create a financial hardship.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is an OIC Mill?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An &#8220;OIC mill&#8221; refers to a business or organization that aggressively markets and promotes OIC services to taxpayers, often making exaggerated claims about their ability to settle tax debts for pennies on the dollar. These companies typically charge high fees and may not deliver on their promises, sometimes providing subpar or even fraudulent services.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to Avoid OIC Mills<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thoroughly research any company or service offering OIC assistance. Look for reviews, complaints, and ratings from reputable sources such as the Better Business Bureau (BBB). <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/which-tax-professionals-are-qualified-to-work-the-irs-on-my-behalf\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ensure the tax professional you\u2019re working with is qualified<\/a>, such as a licensed attorney, CPA, or Enrolled Agent who specializes in tax resolution. Consider contacting the IRS directly or using the IRS\u2019s online resources to understand the OIC program and determine eligibility before seeking outside help. If an offer sounds too good to be true, seek a second opinion from a trusted tax professional. Familiarize yourself with the IRS OIC process and the realistic chances of success. The IRS provides detailed information and forms on their Offer in Compromise page.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve been victimized by an OIC mill, consider asking for help from the experts at Optima Tax Relief.

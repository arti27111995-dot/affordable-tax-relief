Both <span data-contrast=\"auto\">involve the willful attempt to either evade the assessment or the payment of taxes. But at what point does the IRS pursue criminal charges for these actions? What consequences are included in the criminal charges? How does one prevent these charges from being brought upon them? Here\u2019s what you need to know about how and when the IRS pursues criminal charges against a taxpayer.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><strong>What Triggers IRS Criminal Investigations?<\/strong>\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS typically does not pursue criminal charges unless you exhibit a pattern of intentionally breaking tax laws, or when there is evidence of willful violations of tax laws. In other words, these cases typically involve conduct that goes beyond honest mistakes or negligence.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Common Triggers for IRS Criminal Action<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some red flags that may trigger criminal investigations include:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Significant underreporting of income: <\/strong>For example, failing to report large amounts of cash income from a side business.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Repeated failure to file tax returns:<\/strong> Ignoring tax obligations for several years in a row.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Submitting false documents: <\/strong>Fabricating receipts or deductions to reduce tax liability.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Payroll tax fraud:<\/strong> Withholding payroll taxes from employees but failing to remit them to the IRS.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Structuring transactions: <\/strong>Breaking up cash deposits to avoid IRS reporting thresholds (typically $10,000).\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Willful Noncompliance vs. Honest Mistakes<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS makes a clear distinction between taxpayers who make honest mistakes and those who intentionally try to deceive the government. Criminal charges generally require proof that the taxpayer acted willfully \u2014 meaning they knew the law and deliberately chose to break it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Types of Tax Crimes the IRS Prosecutes<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS Criminal Investigation (CI) division investigates a variety of financial crimes, often in collaboration with other federal agencies. Some of the most prosecuted tax crimes include the following.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Tax Evasion (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201)<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tax evasion involves any deliberate act to evade or defeat a tax obligation. This could include hiding income, inflating deductions, or using offshore accounts to conceal earnings. A conviction can result in up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Willful Failure to File a Return (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203)<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Not filing a required tax return, especially over multiple years, may lead to criminal prosecution. Each year not filed can carry its own penalties.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Filing False Returns (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206)<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Falsifying information on a tax return, such as claiming fictitious dependents or fraudulent deductions, is a criminal offense.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Employment Tax Fraud<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Employers who fail to submit employment taxes withheld from employee paychecks can face criminal prosecution. This is viewed as theft from both the employee and the government.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Offshore Account Violations and FBAR Noncompliance<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Taxpayers must report foreign accounts holding more than $10,000. Willfully failing to file an FBAR (Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts) can lead to criminal charges.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How Does the IRS Decide to Pursue Criminal Charges?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision to pursue criminal charges involves a thorough and often lengthy process.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>IRS Criminal Investigation (CI) Division\u2019s Role<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>CI agents investigate potential tax crimes using techniques like surveillance, informants, and forensic accounting. If they find sufficient evidence of wrongdoing, they prepare a report for the Department of Justice (DOJ).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Referral for Prosecution<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Only after the DOJ reviews the case and agrees to prosecute will formal criminal charges be filed. This ensures that only the most serious violations result in criminal trials.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Criteria Considered<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Factors influencing the IRS\u2019s decision to pursue criminal charges include:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Strength of the evidence\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Amount of tax loss to the government\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The deterrent effect of prosecution\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The taxpayer\u2019s history and behavior\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Typical Timeline of an IRS Criminal Investigation<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Initial audit or tip-off\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Referral to CI and investigation begins\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Evidence gathering (subpoenas, surveillance, etc.)\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"4\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Referral to DOJ\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"5\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Grand jury indictment\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"6\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Trial and sentencing, if convicted\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In FY2023, the IRS CI division initiated over 2,676 criminal investigations and identified more than $37.1 billion in tax and financial crimes, with a conviction rate of 88.4% on cases accepted for prosecution.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Are the Penalties for IRS Criminal Convictions?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tax crimes carry serious consequences that can affect every aspect of a person\u2019s life.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Fines, Restitution, and Interest<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Those convicted of tax crimes may be required to pay significant fines, repay the government (restitution), and cover interest on unpaid taxes. You can be fined up to $100,000, or up to $500,000 for corporations. If you are found guilty of filing false tax returns, you can be fined up to $100,000.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Prison Time<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the offense, prison terms can range from one year for minor violations to five or more years for more serious crimes like evasion or conspiracy. The average jail sentence for tax evasion varies between three to five&nbsp;years. If you are found guilty of filing false tax returns, you can face up to three years in prison.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Reputational and Professional Damage<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A criminal conviction can lead to loss of professional licenses, employment, and personal reputation.

He was acquitted of felony tax fraud but convicted of the misdemeanor counts. Snipes was sentenced to three years in prison, which he served from 2010 to 2013. The IRS had initially claimed he owed over $17 million in back taxes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Michael Avenatti \u2013 Tax Fraud and Embezzlement<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Attorney Michael Avenatti was convicted on multiple counts including wire fraud, tax evasion, and bankruptcy fraud.

In cases involving willful fraud or evasion, criminal charges are pursued. Honest mistakes or inability to pay usually result in civil penalties.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em><strong>Q: How do I know if I\u2019m under IRS investigation?<\/strong>\u00a0<\/em><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Signs of an IRS criminal investigation may include special agent visits, subpoenas, or being contacted by someone identifying as part of IRS CI.

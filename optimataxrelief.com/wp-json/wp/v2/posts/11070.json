Now what? First, don\u2019t panic. Not everyone needs to file a tax return. Typically, if you earn less than the standard deduction associated with your filing status, you do not need to file a return. H<\/span>owever, i<span data-contrast=\"none\">f you did not file a tax return w<\/span>hen<span data-contrast=\"none\"> you were required to, you might have an issue.

This penalty is currently 5% of the unpaid taxes for each month or partial month that a tax return is late, up to 25% of your total unpaid tax bill. If you are due to receive a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/why-is-my-refund-smaller-this-year\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">tax refund<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, then you will not receive a penalty for failing to file. However, not filing may result in losing that refund. Keep in mind, a tax refund can be only claimed within 3 years of its due date. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">You will be charged a&nbsp;Failure to Pay&nbsp;penalty.<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you owe tax<\/span>es<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> and do<\/span>n&#8217;t<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> file your r<\/span>eturn<span data-contrast=\"auto\">, you will be penalized for failing to pay. In 2024, the\u00a0Failure to Pay\u00a0penalty\u00a0is 0.5% for each month or partial month your tax balance goes unpaid, up to 25% of your total tax bill. If both a Failure to Pay and a\u00a0Failure to File penalty\u00a0are applied in the same month, the Failure to File penalty will be reduced by the amount of the Failure to Pay penalty applied in that month. For example, instead of a 5% Failure to File penalty for the month, the IRS would apply a 4.5% Failure to File penalty and a 0.5% Failure to Pay penalty. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Your tax bill will accrue interest.<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you do not <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/should-i-file-a-tax-extension\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">file your taxes<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, the IRS will assess interest on your unpaid taxes<\/span>. This is <span data-contrast=\"auto\">even if you do not receive a\u00a0Failure to File\u00a0penalty. Even worse, the IRS begins accruing this interest beginning on the date your taxes are due, which is April 15th in 2024. If you receive the\u00a0Failure to File\u00a0penalty, you <\/span>will also<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> incur interest on your unpaid taxes. Underpayment interest rates can change each quarter. The interest rate through June 2023 is 7% per year, the highest it has ever been.

As a taxpayer, you must be vigilant of any criminal activity that may be occurring and always be sure to protect your sensitive information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS will never email, call, or reach out to you via social media although, quite a few people have reported receiving supposed messages from someone claiming to be from the IRS via one of the platforms mentioned above every year.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common way a scammer will attempt to reach out to a taxpayer is by phone call. Most people who see that an unknown caller is calling them will ignore the call and go about their daily routine only to check their phone later and see that they have received an automated message that is supposedly coming from the IRS.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These messages will typically tell you that they\u2019re from the IRS and that they\u2019re calling you regarding a time sensitive and urgent matter regarding a large sum of money you owe. These messages may even sometimes claim that you will get sued or arrested if you don\u2019t respond immediately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people may even encounter speaking to someone that is impersonating an IRS agent. These scammers will threaten to take action against you if you do not send them the tax balance you supposedly owe right away and sometimes will ask that the payment be made using random forms of payments such as placing the money on gift cards. The impersonator may even ask for personal information like your social security number or banking information over the phone.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS will never leave you threatening voicemails about any possible tax balance or fraud regarding your account and will never ask for you to provide personal information or payments over the phone.&nbsp; If the IRS is attempting to get in contact with you,&nbsp;they will send you a notice via ground mail letting you know if there are any discrepancies on your tax return and will allow you time to respond accordingly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taxpayers should never return a phone call that they receive from someone claiming to be from the IRS and should instead contact the IRS directly to address any concerns they may have. Individuals can reach out to the IRS directly at 800-829-1040 and business owners can call them at 800-829-4933.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to reiterate that the IRS will never discuss your personal tax issues through unsolicited emails, texts, or social media. Always be cautious of any phone calls you receive from someone claiming to be from the IRS who tells you that you owe money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you receive an unexpected and suspicious email from the IRS, forward it to <a href=\"mailto:phishing@irs.gov\">phishing@irs.gov<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you need tax help, contact us for a <strong>free consultation.<\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Affordable Tax Relief provides assistance to individuals struggling with unmanageable IRS tax burdens.

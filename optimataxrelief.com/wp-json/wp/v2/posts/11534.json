These differences are primarily driven by the distinct nature of these rental arrangements and the objectives of tax authorities. Here&#8217;s an overview of the key differences in how long-term and short-term rentals are taxed. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The 14-Day Rule<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Under the 14-day rule, if you rent out your primary residence or a second home for 14 days or fewer during the tax year, you are generally not required to report the rental income on your federal income tax return. In other words, the income you earn from these short-term rentals is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/which-income-types-are-not-taxable\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">tax-exempt<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. To qualify, you must have also occupied the property for at least 14 days.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you use the 14-day rule you cannot deduct rental-related expenses, such as advertising, cleaning, and maintenance, against that income. However, you can deduct property taxes and mortgage interest paid. The 14-day rule is a federal tax provision, and state and local tax laws may vary.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Active vs. Passive Income<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you have a rental property, how you are taxed also depends on whether your income is passive or active. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Passive Rental Income<\/span><\/i><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Usually, rental income is considered passive, meaning it doesn\u2019t require active participation. This is usually the case for long-term rentals in which you might just collect a rent check each month. This income is generally taxed at the same rate as your regular income. In addition, you may <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/tax-deductions-you-can-claim-without-itemizing\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">deduct<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> operating expenses including advertising, commissions, repairs, maintenance, landscaping, insurance, HOA fees, property taxes, mortgage interest, depreciation, and more. Passive rental income should be reported on Schedule E of Form 1040. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Active Rental Income<\/span><\/i><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">There are a few instances in which rental income becomes active. These include:<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you are classified as a real estate professional (work at least 750 hours in real estate per year, and 50% of work being in real estate)<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you are renting your property through an LLC or S Corporation<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you have short-term rentals (STRs) that have an average stay length of 7 days or less<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you occupy your rental for more than 14 days, or 10% of the number of days the property is rented out<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you provide \u201csubstantial services\u201d to your tenants, including meals, transportation, daily housekeeping, and more.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If one of these scenarios applies to you, your income will likely be considered active in the IRS\u2019s eyes. This means the IRS will consider you to be self-employed and will require you to pay self-employment tax. However, you can deduct up to $25,000 of loss from activity if you are single or married filing jointly. You can deduct up to $12,500 if you are married but file separately. Active rental income and expenses should be reported on Schedule C. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Qualified expenses include rental expenses like advertising, credit checks, and agency fees. You can also deduct general expenses like cleaning fees, repairs, depreciation, mortgage interest, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/ask-phil-taxes-and-real-estate\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">property taxes<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, utilities, etc. However, you may only deduct a percentage of general expenses that is equal to the occupancy rate for the year. For example, if your rental was occupied for 150 days out of the year, you could deduct 41% of the expenses (150\/365). <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Tax Help for Those with Rental Income<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">It&#8217;s essential for property owners to be aware of the tax implications associated with their rental activities. Consult with tax professionals or local authorities to ensure compliance with relevant tax laws and regulations. Tax laws can vary significantly by jurisdiction. That said, it&#8217;s crucial to stay informed about the specific rules that apply to your rental situation. Additionally, tax laws and regulations can change over time, so regular updates and compliance checks are essential for all rental property owners.

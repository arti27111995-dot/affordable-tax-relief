However, it is known that one of the best ways to build long-term wealth is to start investing early. Doing will allow your money to compound interest for a longer period of time. More than anything, knowing investment tips will help you get started. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Invest in a High-Yield Savings Account&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This investment tip is great for those who are just getting started and may be hesitant to try stock trading. Like a traditional savings account, a&nbsp;high-yield savings account pays interest on your account balance. The main difference is that the rates of a high-yield savings account are far higher than those of a traditional account. In fact, the rates are 20-25 times the national average of traditional accounts. This investment is ideal for building an emergency fund or safety net. It is money that is not meant to be touched but is still easily accessible when needed. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Open an Individual Retirement Account (IRA)&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>College days may seem early to begin thinking about retirement, but the sooner you start saving the better. One of the best ways to begin retirement savings is through an IRA account.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional IRA accounts allow tax-deductible contributions on state and federal tax returns for the year the contribution was made. When you withdraw the money for retirement (beginning at 59 \u00bd years old), you will be taxed at that income tax&nbsp;rate. This is important to consider as some people will be in a higher tax bracket when they retire because of Social Security benefits, investment income, and more. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/roth-ira-penalties\/\">Roth IRAs<\/a> are usually more popular with young adults because the earnings and contributions to the account compound tax-free. In other words, you pay taxes on the money before you contribute so you don\u2019t have to pay it later. However, your contributions do not qualify as tax deductions. This option is also better for those who anticipate being in a higher tax bracket at retirement age. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Invest with a Robo-Advisor&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This investment tip is ideal for those who want to invest through a brokerage account for cheap without doing a ton of research. <a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/how-investment-apps-affect-your-taxes\/\">Robo-advisors<\/a> use artificial intelligence to create one-of-a-kind investment portfolios based on your goals. These goals are determined by amount of time left before retirement and risk level. This option usually does not require paying fees for small accounts, so there is not much risk involved in getting started. However, you may be required to pay a small percentage of your assets each year&nbsp;once you reach a certain account balance. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tax Relief for Investors&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The best investment tip is to always ensure you are compliant with tax laws and to report your investment earnings each year. affordable Tax Relief is the nation\u2019s leading tax resolution firm with over $1 billion in resolved tax liabilities.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If You Need Tax Help, Contact Us Today for a\u00a0<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/app.affordabletaxrelief.com\/tax-problems\/?t=99&amp;utm_source=otr-blog-post&amp;utm_campaign=blog-cta&amp;adgroup=free-consultation&amp;network=otr-blogl&amp;ad=08-09-2022\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Free Consultation<\/strong><\/a>\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The world of investments can be intimidating, especially for young adults and college students.

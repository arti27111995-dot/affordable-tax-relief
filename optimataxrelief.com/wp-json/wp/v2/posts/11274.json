If you pay a household employee over a certain amount, the IRS expects you to handle payroll taxes like an actual employer. That\u2019s where Schedule H comes in. In this guide, we\u2019ll explain everything you need to know about Schedule H: Household Employment Taxes, including who needs to file it, what taxes apply, and how to stay compliant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-schedule-h-nbsp\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What is Schedule H?<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Schedule H is a supplemental IRS form used by individuals who hire household employees and need to report employment taxes. Rather than filing business payroll returns, household employers use Schedule H to report:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Social Security and Medicare taxes (<a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/blog\/what-is-fica-tax\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">FICA<\/a>)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Any withheld federal income tax<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This form is attached to the employer\u2019s personal tax return (Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR) and is due by the annual tax deadline.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>Why It Matters<\/em><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Household workers are considered employees under IRS rules &#8211; not independent contractors. That means you, as the employer, are responsible for calculating and paying the appropriate employment taxes, even if your \u201cbusiness\u201d is just your home. Failing to file Schedule H can result in penalties, interest, or even an audit. But with the right tools and knowledge, it\u2019s manageable and legal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who Needs to File Schedule H?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You must file Schedule H if all the following apply:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You paid any one household employee cash wages totaling $2,700 or more in 2024 or $2,800 in 2025<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The employee is not an independent contractor or from an agency that handles employment taxes.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The work was performed in or around your private home.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll also need to file if you withheld any federal income tax from your household employee\u2019s paycheck, even if you paid them less than the wage threshold.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>Who Doesn\u2019t Need to File?<\/em><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\u2019t need to file Schedule H if:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The worker was a self-employed individual (e.g., landscapers who use their own equipment and set their own schedule).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You hired a company or agency that manages payroll and employment (e.g., a professional cleaning service).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The worker earned less than the wage threshold and you didn\u2019t withhold any taxes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who Qualifies as a Household Employee?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the IRS, a household employee is someone who performs domestic work in or around your private residence and you control what work is done and how it is done. This includes behavioral, financial, and relational control, similar to the rules for classifying employees in a business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>Examples of Household Employees<\/em><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Nannies and babysitters (if working regularly)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Senior caregivers or aides (not provided through an agency)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Housekeepers and maids<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Private chefs or cooks<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Drivers or chauffeurs<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you hire a nanny to care for your child 30 hours a week and you set their schedule and job duties, that person is a household employee. If you occasionally use a babysitter who sets their own rates and hours, they may be considered self-employed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When You&#8217;re Required to Pay Household Employment Taxes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two key thresholds that trigger tax obligations:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Social Security and Medicare Taxes (FICA):<\/strong> If you pay $2,700 or more in cash wages to a household employee in 2024  ($2,800 in 2025), you must pay both the employer and employee portions of Social Security and Medicare taxes.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA):<\/strong> If you paid $1,000 or more in any calendar quarter during the year to any household employee, you are also required to pay FUTA.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>These thresholds are cumulative per household employee. Paying $900 per month to a housekeeper would put you over both limits in just over three months.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>Types of Taxes Owed<\/em><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When Schedule H is required, you may be responsible for the following taxes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Social Security and Medicare (FICA):<\/strong> Equal to 15.3% of the employee\u2019s wages. You can pay both the employer and employee portions yourself or withhold the employee share from their pay.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA):<\/strong> Generally 6% on the first $7,000 of wages. This can be reduced by state unemployment taxes paid.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Federal Income Tax Withholding (Optional):<\/strong> You are not required to <a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/blog\/how-to-calculate-your-withholding-so-you-dont-owe-or-overpay\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">withhold federal income tax<\/a> unless your employee requests it and you agree.

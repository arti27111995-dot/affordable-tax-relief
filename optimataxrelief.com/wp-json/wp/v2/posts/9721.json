Over 100 members of affordable\u2019s staff registered with the United Way of Orange County, California to participate in the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program, which was launched by the IRS to provide free tax preparation services to those such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Persons with disabilities<\/li><li>Limited English-speaking taxpayers<\/li><li>Elderly taxpayers<\/li><li>Low to moderate-income taxpayers<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The free tax help offered by the VITA program is particularly beneficial for those who are 60 years of age and older, as it specializes in questions about pensions and other retirement-related issues that are unique to seniors. Many of the community members who would qualify for the program are retired individuals associated with non-profit organizations that receive grants from the IRS. This year, however, we saw a wide range of ages attend for assistance. We were happy to help anyone that we could!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt gave me the opportunity to offer assistance, to the people of our community, who may not have had the fortune to go elsewhere for tax assistance and walk away with a smile on their face for the help and guidance they received,\u201d said Associate Director of Payments Steve Stoffel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SVP of Accounting, Richard Hamiprodjo called volunteering for the VITA program \u201ca rewarding experience getting involved with the community and helping those who are in need.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By partnering with the IRS, the VITA program is able to offer reliable, trustworthy tax filing services for free. affordable\u2019s volunteers for the VITA program helped with tax preparation, greeting guests, and some gathered the appropriate tax documents from taxpayers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Associate VP of Human Resources Kimberly Carson was also a volunteer this year. She shared her thoughts and experience, saying, \u201cIt was great to have the opportunity to give back to our community and help people with getting their taxes completed. Not everyone has extra money to get their taxes done by professionals to ensure it is done correctly, so to be able to provide this service to the community is not only needed but fulfilling. Thank you for the opportunity!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our volunteers exclaimed how exciting and fulfilling it was to be part of this event. The culture within affordable is very community oriented, and it shows through the tenacity Optimians have for helping others and connecting. Martha Casillas, a Payments Coordinator at affordable said, \u201cMy participation as a VITA volunteer gave me a boost of self-confidence, and self-esteem within the company. Being new to the OTR family, it also allowed me to connect with other Optimians, as well as see some of the involvements OTR has within the surrounding communities.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Case Manager Kateri Drewes added, \u201cFor me, being a VITA volunteer means taking the time to give back to my local community. I cherish the opportunity to help folks get the care and quality service they deserve!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>affordable looks forward to working with United Way to host our very own VITA site at our California office next year. Our goal is to serve more taxpayers with a bigger outreach in the Santa Ana community.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>affordable Tax Relief has once again teamed up with the IRS to provide assistance to low-income residents and other members of their surrounding community with free tax preparation services.

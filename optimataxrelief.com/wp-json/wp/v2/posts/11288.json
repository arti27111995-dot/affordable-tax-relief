However, as our society undergoes demographic shifts and economic challenges, it has become increasingly evident that the current system requires substantial reform to remain viable for future generations. So, what&#8217;s going on with Social Security reform lately? Here we will break down why reform is becoming necessary and what political leaders are suggesting we do to improve the current situation as of July 2023.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The Challenge with Social Security<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The Social Security program was established in 1935 during a different era when life expectancy was lower, birth rates were higher, and the ratio of workers to retirees was far more favorable. Now, some of the latest projections show that the programs combined funds could run out in 2034. Today, the system faces numerous challenges that threaten its long-term viability, including:<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Aging Population: The baby boomer generation, a substantial portion of the population, is rapidly reaching retirement age, putting immense pressure on the system. With fewer workers contributing to support a growing number of retirees, the sustainability of the current pay-as-you-go model is at risk.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Declining Birth Rates: Modern societies are experiencing declining birth rates, resulting in a shrinking workforce. This trend further exacerbates the strain on the system as there are fewer future contributors to Social Security.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Economic Uncertainty: Economic downturns, like the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, have weakened the economy and reduced government revenue, leading to concerns about the long-term funding of Social Security.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Proposed Solutions<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">To ensure the long-term viability of Social Security, policymakers and experts have put forth various reform proposals. While no single solution can address all challenges, a combination of measures can create a more sustainable system:<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Gradual Retirement Age Increase<\/span><\/i><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">One option is to gradually raise the full retirement age. People are living longer and staying healthier, so adjusting the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/how-to-choose-a-retirement-account\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">retirement<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> age to reflect longer life expectancies can help maintain a balanced system. For example, one proposal includes raising the full retirement age to 68 and another suggests raising the retirement age to 70. However, such a change should be implemented gradually to allow people to adjust their retirement plans accordingly.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Adjusting Cost-of-Living Adjustments (COLAs)<\/span><\/i><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The automatic annual increase in Social Security benefits, based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), can be revised to better reflect the changing cost of living for retirees. A more accurate COLA calculation would ensure beneficiaries receive sufficient support while easing the financial burden on the program.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Increasing Payroll Taxes<\/span><\/i><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Another consideration is raising the payroll tax cap, which currently limits the amount of income subject to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/taxes-on-social-security-benefits\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Social Security taxes<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. Currently, the maximum amount of income that is subject to Social Security taxes is $160,200. Many are proposing raising the minimum to either $250,000 or $400,000. Increasing this cap would require higher-income earners to contribute more to the system, bolstering its financial health.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Means-Testing<\/span><\/i><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Introducing means-testing for Social Security benefits could help direct assistance to those who need it most. By reducing or eliminating benefits for higher-income retirees, the system can allocate resources more efficiently to support vulnerable populations. Some are proposing to reduce benefits if a taxpayer has an AGI within a certain threshold, and even cut benefits completely if their AGI enters a higher threshold. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Finding the Balance<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">While reform is essential for the sustainability of Social Security, any changes must be made with careful consideration of the program&#8217;s fundamental purpose: to provide economic s<\/span>afety <span data-contrast=\"auto\">for vulnerable <\/span>groups<span data-contrast=\"auto\">. Policymakers should balance the need for fiscal responsibility with compassion for those who heavily rely on Social Security for their basic needs. On the other hand, some Social Security income is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/is-canceled-debt-taxable\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">taxable<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, so taxpayers should prepare for possible reform that could affect their taxes.

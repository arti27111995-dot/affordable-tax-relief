Expenses like travel, meals, and lodging can be cut from their total income.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This means that if a professional player won $1 million and showed business expenses of $100,000 million during the year \u2013 he would only pay taxes on $900,000.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Are You a Professional Gambler?<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So how do you prove to the IRS that you\u2019re a professional gambler? Show that you treat the game like a business all year long; that you play to make a profit, not to have fun with your friends.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The federal tax code uses nine guidelines to determine what qualifies as professional gambling, and what doesn&#8217;t. Here are a few of those guidelines adapted from\u00a0<a id=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/journalofaccountancy.com\/Issues\/2012\/Apr\/20114684.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" shape=\"rect\">an article last year<\/a>\u00a0in the\u00a0Journal of Accountancy.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Gambling Guidelines<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Make a profit.<\/strong> Everyone loses money sometimes. But if you never win or profit, it\u2019s hard to suggest that you make a living by gambling. This is the same way the IRS distinguishes between a small business and a hobby.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Keep records\u00a0<\/strong>of the time you spend practicing and competing. Maintaining books and records show that you\u2019re not just a casual gambler, you can prove that you\u2019re a professional.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Study hard.<\/strong> Prepare for each tournament with a poker expert. This will show you consider gambling your job, and that improving your game is part of professional development.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Don&#8217;t have an entourage.<\/strong> Since gambling is usually for fun, you have to show that you are not playing for pleasure, but for a living. It is better to go by yourself. If you want family and friends to keep you company,\u00a0don\u2019t\u00a0include them in your business expenses.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Like most tax issues, accurate and proper tax planning is key. With a sensitive issue, such as professional gambling, having your tax strategy be IRS ready will be vital in keeping your winnings in your pocket.\u00a0 Winning against the Internal Revenue Service is possible, as long as you hold the right cards in your hand.&#8221; &#8211;Andrew Park, Enrolled Agent at Affordable Tax Relief.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>How to Report Gambling Winnings?<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Gambling winnings are reported through IRS Form W-2G. Depending on how much you win and the type of gambling you undertake, you may receive this form directly from the \u201cpayer\u201d or organization from which you won the money. If the payer withholds federal income tax from your winnings, you will receive a Form W-2G. This form, according to Robert W. Wood of Forbes.com, works just like a 1099 Interest Form that you receive as part of tax time preparation forms. He reminds everyone the IRS also receives a copy of the Form W-2G and reminds winners to keep it handy for tax time to ensure full compliance!<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If gambling winnings do not meet the following thresholds set by the IRS for the respective type of gambling, it must be reported as \u201cOther income.\u201d<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Bingo or slot machines:<\/strong>\u00a0\u00a0<span class=\"highlight1\">$1,200<\/span><br \/>\n<strong>Keno:<\/strong>\u00a0\u00a0<span class=\"highlight1\">$1,500<\/span><br \/>\n<strong>Poker Tournament:<\/strong>\u00a0\u00a0<span class=\"highlight1\">$5,000<\/span>\u00a0(excluding wager or buy-in amounts)<br \/>\n<strong>\u201cOther\u201d gambling winnings:<\/strong>\u00a0\u00a0<span class=\"highlight1\">$600<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u201cOther\u201d gambling winnings are those that do not include poker tournaments, slot machines, bingo, and keno \u2013 and the payout is at least 300 times the wager amount).<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What if My Winnings don\u2019t Meet the Above Thresholds?<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">No matter how much income is generated from gambling, it must be reported if you receive a Form W-2G or not. If your winnings do not meet the threshold, you must report your income under the \u201cOther Income\u201d line on the Form 1040 U.S. Individual Income Tax Return.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What do I Do if I Lose Money From Gambling?<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Gambling losses may be deducted. Deductions are permitted up to the winning amount. Losses must be reported, as an Itemized Deduction, on Schedule A, separately from any winnings.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How are Winnings and Losses Substantiated?<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The IRS requires proof of losses and winnings. In case of an audit and to maintain the integrity of your income tax return, the IRS recommends keeping all records related to winnings and losses. Items to substantiate gambling transactions include tickets, receipts, checks, and IRS Form W-2G (if given). Maintaining a notebook or other written documentation is highly suggested to keep winnings and losses separate and organized.<\/p>\n<h2>What Expenses Can Be Deducted?<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Like most small businesses, professional gamblers can\u00a0<a id=\"\" title=\"Tax Tip: Deductions for Travel and Business\" href=\"https:\/\/www.affordabletaxrelief.com\/tax-tip-deductions-for-travel-and-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" shape=\"rect\">deduct expenses<\/a>\u00a0that the IRS considers \u201cordinary and necessary\u201d to \u201ccarrying on any trade or business.\u201d The website\u00a0<a id=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/professionalgamblerstatus.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" shape=\"rect\">ProfessionalGamblerStatus.com<\/a>\u00a0provides a long\u00a0<a id=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/professionalgamblerstatus.com\/professionalgambler.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" shape=\"rect\">list<\/a> of tax deductions for professional gamblers you can deduct, ranging from internet connections (if you play online), to flights, car trips, and meals when you travel to tournaments.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">List of Possible Deductions<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\">Internet Costs, if you regularly play online<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Home office expenses<\/li>\n<li>Tax advice<\/li>\n<li>Subscriptions to gambling magazines and newspapers<\/li>\n<li>Gaming fees, chat room fees<\/li>\n<li>Club membership fees and dues<\/li>\n<li>Clerical and record-keeping expenses<\/li>\n<li>Travel and meal costs during tournaments<\/li>\n<li>Wages paid to relatives or employees for their assistance<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can also deduct money used to hire a poker coach or someone to keep track of your results. The payment just needs to be \u201ca reasonable allowance for salaries or other compensation for personal services actually rendered,\u201d according to the\u00a0<a id=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.fourmilab.ch\/ustax\/www\/t26-A-1-B-VI-162.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" shape=\"rect\">IRS<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To comply with the laws, make sure you don\u2019t look like you\u2019re trying to take advantage of the system. For instance, taking a taxi and flying coach would arouse less suspicion than renting a private jet and a stretched limo. That also applies for high rollers, who are often offered complimentary hotel rooms, buffets, and rides by casinos. Don\u2019t try to pass those off freebies as expenses.<\/p>\n<p>So what if you\u2019re not a professional but you drive 60 miles, eat lunch, and have a great day at the track? Since you\u2019re not a professional gambler, you can\u2019t deduct any expenses.

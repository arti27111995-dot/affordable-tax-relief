These adjustments are designed to prevent taxpayers from being pushed into higher tax brackets due to inflation. We\u2019ve discussed the updated tax brackets and standard deductions in a previous post. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the other most significant changes for 2025. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) Exemption Amounts<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The AMT exemption amounts for 2025 have increased to provide relief to middle- and upper-middle-income taxpayers. While the <a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/blog\/what-is-alternative-minimum-tax\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Alternative Minimum Tax<\/a> ensures that high-income earners pay at least a minimum level of tax, the AMT exemption acts as a deduction from AMT income. This effectively lowers the income subject to the AMT. Single filers can take advantage of an $88,100 AMT exemption while those married filing separately can exclude $68,650. The AMT exemption starts to phase out once income reaches certain thresholds. The exemption begins to phase out at $626,350 for single filers and those married filing separately. Married couples filing jointly will see an exemption of $137,000 in 2025, which will begin to phase out at $1,252,700. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For low- and moderate-income earners, the EITC helps reduce the tax liability of low- to moderate-income workers, especially those with children. The maximum EITC for 2025 will be $8,046. The amount a taxpayer will qualify for will depend on their income threshold and the number of qualifying children they claim on their tax return. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Estate Tax Credits and Exemptions<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/blog\/an-overview-of-estate-and-inheritance-taxes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">federal estate tax exemption<\/a> allows estates below a certain threshold to transfer wealth tax-free, with the credit reducing the tax owed on larger estates. For 2025, the estate exemption will increase to $13.99 million per individual (or $27.98 million for married couples), up from $13.61 million in 2024. This change allows wealthier estates to transfer more wealth tax-free.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Annual Exclusion for Gifts<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The gift tax exclusion is an annual&nbsp;tax-free limit on the amount an individual can gift to another without triggering federal gift tax reporting. This limit&nbsp;will rise to $19,000 per recipient, up from $18,000 in 2024. Taxpayers can gift this amount to as many individuals as they like without affecting their lifetime exemption.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Adoption Credits<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The adoption credit is a nonrefundable tax credit that helps offset qualifying adoption expenses, with income-based phaseouts. The maximum adoption credit for 2025 will increase to $17,280 per eligible child, up from $16,810 in 2024. Income phaseouts for the credit will also be adjusted upward.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Health Flexible Spending <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/blog\/what-is-a-cafeteria-plan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Cafeteria Plans<\/strong><\/a><strong><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The maximum contribution limit for health flexible spending accounts (FSAs) in 2025 will rise to $3,300, up from $3,200 in 2024. The carryover limit for unused funds will increase to $660, giving participants greater flexibility in managing healthcare expenses.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Qualified Transportation Fringe Benefit<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Qualified Transportation Fringe Benefit is a tax-free benefit that employers can offer to their employees to help cover commuting expenses. The 2025 monthly limit for employer-provided transportation benefits will increase to $325 for parking and transit, up from $315in 2024. This adjustment reflects rising costs for commuting and parking. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Foreign Earned Income Exclusion<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/blog\/what-is-the-foreign-earned-income-exclusion\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">foreign earned income exclusion<\/a> for 2025 will rise to $130,000, up from $126,500 in 2024. This adjustment helps expatriates offset the increased cost of living abroad. Be sure to understand all the requirements of excluding foreign earnings. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs)<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An MSA is a&nbsp;tax-advantaged savings account for individuals with high-deductible health plans to cover medical expenses, with contributions and withdrawals subject to specific rules. In 2025, the annual deductible for self-only coverage cannot be less than $2,850 but not more than $4,300. The maximum out-of-pocket expenses for self-only coverage will increase to $5,700. In addition, family coverage figures have been adjusted. The minimum annual deductible for family coverage will be $5,700, but no more than $8,550. The maximum out-of-pocket expense limit for family coverage will be $10,500.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tax Help in 2025<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These inflation adjustments for 2025 provide financial relief across various tax provisions, ensuring that taxpayers can maintain their purchasing power amidst rising costs.

However, beyond the joy of becoming a homeowner, it&#8217;s crucial to understand the tax implications that come with this major financial commitment. In this blog post, we&#8217;ll explore the various tax considerations related to buying a home, providing you with valuable insights to help you navigate this aspect of homeownership confidently. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Itemizing Deductions<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Purchasing a home may be the first opportunity you receive to start itemizing your deductions during tax time. While itemizing can require much more work, it could result in a larger refund. I<\/span>f<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> you want to claim any expenses related to your hom<\/span>e<span data-contrast=\"auto\">, you must itemize your deductions. T<\/span>his might include expenses <span data-contrast=\"auto\"> such as mortgage interest or real estate taxes<\/span>. <span data-contrast=\"auto\">Consulting with a knowledgeable tax professional can give you a better understanding of your best option is.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Mortgage Interest Deduction<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you have a home loan that originated after December 16, 2017, you can deduct mortgage interest, up to $750,000. Any loan with an origination date before this qualifies for a mortgage interest deduction of up to $1 million. To qualify for this deduction, you must itemize your deductions on your tax return and meet certain eligibility criteria. Every January, your home lender should send you Form 1098, Mortgage Interest Statement<\/span>. This <span data-contrast=\"auto\">reports mortgage interest of $600 or more you paid during the year. If you paid less than $600 in mortgage interest, you can still deduct it during tax time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In addition to mortgage interest, your 1098 will also show much you paid in mortgage points during the year. Mortgage points are a form of payment made to obtain your mortgage<\/span>. They <span data-contrast=\"auto\">are generally defined as a percentage of your loan amount. For instance, let\u2019s assume\u00a0you paid three points, or 3%, on your $500,000 mortgage, for a total of $15,000 (3% of $500,000). The IRS will typically allow you to deduct the entire amount of your points in the year they were paid. \u00a0You should note that the deductible amount should be shown on your 1098 form.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Real Estate Tax Deduction<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">As a homeowner, one of your expenses will be real estate taxes. The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/what-assets-can-the-irs-seize\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">IRS<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> allows you to\u00a0deduct only the actual real estate tax amounts paid during the year<\/span>. However, <span data-contrast=\"auto\">you can also deduct local property taxes as well. If you pay these taxes through your lender, this amount should be shown on Form 1098. If you just purchased a home, you may have reimbursed the seller for their real estate tax payments. I<\/span>n this <span data-contrast=\"auto\">case, you will be able to deduct this amount through the real estate tax deduction too. <\/span>Remember to keep records of any payments you made. <span data-contrast=\"auto\">Beginning in 2018, the total amount of state and local taxes you can deduct, including property taxes, is capped at $10,000 per year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Home Energy Credits<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Homeowners can also claim tax credits by making some energy efficient upgrades to their home. Specifically, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/how-going-green-at-home-can-save-money-during-tax-time\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> and the Residential Clean Energy Credit are great tax credits for those who recently made home improvements that help conserve energy. Some examples include energy-efficient windows, exterior doors, furnaces, air conditioners, solar panels, and more. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Mortgage Interest Credit<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The IRS allows lower-income and moderate-income taxpayers to claim the Mortgage Interest Credit if they received a mortgage credit certificate (MCC) from their <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/what-you-need-to-know-about-state-tax-audits\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">state<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> or local government. An MCC is usually given to first-time homeowners, and it allows you to claim the credit of up to $2,000 of the mortgage interest paid per year. Taxpayers should note that this credit is completely separate from the mortgage interest deduction that uses Form 1098. The Mortgage Interest Credit can be claimed using Form 8396.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Tax Help for Homeowners<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The tax benefits of homeownership can provide notable savings and financial advantages.

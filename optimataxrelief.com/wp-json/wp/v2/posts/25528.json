It can be expensive. Between fuel, meals, lodging, maintenance, and regulatory fees, truck drivers often face significant business costs just to keep moving. The good news is that many of these expenses can be deducted from your taxable income, reducing the amount you owe the IRS. This guide covers the most common tax deductions for truck drivers, whether you\u2019re an owner-operator or a company driver. We\u2019ll walk through IRS rules, eligible expenses, what doesn\u2019t qualify, and strategies to make sure you\u2019re not leaving money on the table.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Who Can Claim These Deductions<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not every truck driver qualifies for the same deductions, so it\u2019s important to know whether your work status allows you to take advantage of them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Owner-Operators \/ Independent Contractors (1099 Drivers)<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re self-employed, the IRS views you as running your own business. That means you file your taxes using Schedule C (Profit or Loss from Business), and your trucking-related expenses can be deducted to reduce your taxable income.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you earned $120,000 as a long-haul owner-operator and spent $45,000 on fuel, maintenance, and other business costs, you\u2019d only be taxed on $75,000 (before factoring in other deductions). The catch is that you must keep detailed records and only deduct expenses that are ordinary (common in the trucking industry) and necessary (directly related to earning your income).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Company Drivers (W-2 Employees)<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) took effect in 2018, most W-2 employees can no longer deduct unreimbursed job expenses on their federal returns. That means if you\u2019re a company driver and your employer doesn\u2019t reimburse you for meals or tools, you generally can\u2019t deduct them federally. There are two exceptions worth noting:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>State tax rules:<\/strong> Some states still allow these deductions, even if the federal return does not.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Employer per diem programs:\u00a0<\/strong>If your company offers a per diem allowance for meals and incidental expenses, it can reduce your taxable income.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>IRS Rules on Vehicle Expenses<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Truck drivers must follow specific IRS guidelines for deducting vehicle-related costs, which often differ from rules for standard passenger cars. The IRS treats heavy vehicles like semi-trucks as qualified non-personal use vehicles. This classification means you cannot use the standard mileage rate (currently 70 cents per mile for 2025). Instead, you must use the actual expense method, tracking all costs related to operating your truck.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Common deductible <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/how-to-track-and-deduct-business-use-of-a-personal-vehicle\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">vehicle expenses<\/a> include:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Fuel:<\/strong> Diesel, DEF fluid, and even additives count.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Maintenance &amp; Repairs: <\/strong>Oil changes, tire replacements, brake work, and other upkeep.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Insurance: <\/strong>Liability, cargo, and physical damage coverage.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Depreciation: <\/strong>The cost of your truck is deducted over time, based on IRS schedules.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Washing &amp; Detailing:<\/strong>\u00a0Keeping your truck clean for business purposes.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Registration Fees &amp; Permits:<\/strong> Annual state fees and permits tied to operating your vehicle.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s look at an example. Say you purchased a new semi-truck for $150,000. You could depreciate it over three years for regular tax purposes (or four years for Alternative Minimum Tax rules). A $20,000 trailer purchase would typically depreciate over five years.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Common Deductible Expenses<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From meals on the road to safety equipment, there are numerous expense categories that can lower a truck driver\u2019s taxable income.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Travel &amp; Per Diem<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Over-the-road truck drivers often qualify for travel-related deductions because their work requires them to be away from their tax home for more than a standard workday.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key deductible items include:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Lodging: <\/strong>Hotel, motel, or rental stays while on dispatch.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Meals:<\/strong> Deductible using either the actual cost or the IRS per diem rate for transportation workers.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Laundry:<\/strong> Washing clothes while away from home.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Parking &amp; Tolls:<\/strong> Fees incurred during work trips.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Truck divers should also keep the \u201cAway from Home\u201d Rule in mind. It says you must be away long enough to require sleep or rest before returning home. Driving eight hours and returning the same night doesn\u2019t qualify.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Equipment, Tools &amp; Supplies<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>These deductions cover gear that helps you perform your job safely and efficiently.

Even though life on the road blurs the line between personal and business expenses, the IRS has clear boundaries:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Personal Expenses \u2013<\/strong> Souvenirs, movies, or sightseeing while on a route.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Commuting Costs \u2013 <\/strong>Driving from your home to your first dispatch location.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Clothing \u2013 <\/strong>Everyday wear like jeans or t-shirts, even if only worn while driving.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Personal Hygiene Products \u2013 <\/strong>Shampoo, toothpaste, razors, unless part of a DOT-mandated kit.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you pick up snacks at a truck stop for personal consumption, that\u2019s not deductible unless they qualify as a meal during a deductible travel period.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Record-Keeping Best Practices<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Meticulous record-keeping ensures your deductions are valid and defensible if the IRS audits your return. Good documentation is the backbone of claiming tax deductions for truck drivers. The IRS requires you to keep receipts and records proving each expense was business-related.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Best practices include:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/how-to-track-business-expenses-for-taxes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Digital Tracking<\/strong><\/a><strong>: <\/strong>Use an app or spreadsheet to log expenses daily.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Save Receipts: <\/strong>Paper or digital copies are acceptable.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Logbook Details: <\/strong>Keep records of dates, locations, and purpose of trips.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tax Filing Implications<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your tax filing requirements and opportunities for deductions depend on whether you\u2019re self-employed or an employee.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re self-employed, you\u2019ll file:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Schedule C \u2013 <\/strong>Reports income and expenses from your trucking business.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Schedule SE \u2013<\/strong> Calculates self-employment tax.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You may also qualify for the Qualified Business Income (QBI) Deduction, allowing you to deduct up to 20% of your net business income.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a heavy vehicle operator and your truck has a taxable gross weight of 55,000 pounds or more, you must file Form 2290 and pay the Heavy Vehicle Use Tax.

While federal tax law restricts W-2 employees from deducting job expenses, some states, like California and New York, still allow them on state returns. This can be a valuable break for company drivers who have unreimbursed expenses.

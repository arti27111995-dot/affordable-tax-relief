Form 1099-C is sent to people who were so deep in debt, their creditors agreed to give them a break<\/span>. They do this by <span data-contrast=\"none\">either reduc<\/span>ing<span data-contrast=\"none\"> or cancell<\/span>ing<span data-contrast=\"none\"> their debt altogether. Think foreclosures, short sales, credit card debt settlements, and similar debt consolidation methods. The issue is that in the eyes of the IRS the cancelled debt has not disappeared. Instead, it has transformed into a new source of taxable income: debt income.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Why Do You Have to Pay Taxes on Cancelled Debt?<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you have received an IRS Form 1099-C, your first reaction was probably disbelief. It does seem counterintuitive to have to pay taxes on cancelled debt. H<\/span>owever, the <span data-contrast=\"auto\">IRS\u2019s response is that when you borrowed that money you did not have to pay taxes on it because you were bound by contract to pay it back. If you had repaid the debt, it would have been as if you had never really owned the money. However, when a creditor releases you of a liability, you are in effect receiving a payment you did not return<\/span>. This <span data-contrast=\"auto\">is a definition of income.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1099-C Disputes<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Creditors who cancel a debt of $600 or more are required by law to report the amount of debt discharged to the IRS by filing a 1099-C and sending a copy to the debtor.\u00a0It\u2019s worth mentioning that these creditors can make errors on these forms. I<\/span>f<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> you <\/span>disagree<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> with the amount on the form, you need to contact the creditor and request a correct<\/span>ion<span data-contrast=\"auto\">.\u00a0The <\/span>c<span data-contrast=\"auto\">reditor<\/span>&#8216;s <span data-contrast=\"auto\">address and telephone number should be on the top of the form. If it turns out the creditor made a mistake, they can issue a new 1099-C with the correct information.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Discrepancies and Tax Audits<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">It is worth highlighting that the IRS also receives a copy of the information on your 1099-C. If you fail to report taxable debt income when you file your taxes, you may have to pay an additional negligence penalty<\/span>. You also need to pay<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> interest on your taxes, as well as other sanctions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you do not agree with the debt income amount and you cannot resolve the issue with the creditor, things get tricky. You can make a note in your tax return. However<\/span>,<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> discrepancies between your tax return and 1099-C forms, even when accompanied by explanatory notes, are tax audit magnets. Therefore<\/span>,<span data-contrast=\"auto\"> you should prepare yourself and expect\u00a0the IRS to want a closer look at your accounts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Exceptions and Exclusions<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Not all types of unpaid debts are taxable.<\/span> In addition, y<span data-contrast=\"auto\">ou may qualify for exclusions that could either reduce or even cancel your tax liability.

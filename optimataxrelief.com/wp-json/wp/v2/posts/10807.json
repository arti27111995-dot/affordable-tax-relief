The IRS Fresh Start Program, launched in 2011, is a collection of relief tools, from installment agreements, Offers in Compromise (OIC), lien withdrawal, penalty relief, and more. It was designed to help taxpayers and small businesses regain control of their finances.\u00a0Rather than being a single procedure, it&#8217;s a collection: from easier monthly payments to potentially settling your debts. The IRS created it to reduce aggressive collection actions like levies, garnishments, liens, and asset seizures while ensuring taxpayers pay what they can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-history-of-the-fresh-start-program-nbsp-nbsp\"><strong>The History of the Fresh Start Program&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fresh Start Initiative was established in 2011 to give first-time tax offenders leniency and the opportunity to solve their tax issues through consolidated tax bills and payment arrangements. Shortly after launching the program, the IRS made it easier to remove federal tax liens. It also&nbsp;allowed taxpayers to come to more favorable payment arrangements with the IRS. One year after that, the IRS gave more taxpayers access to the Offer in Compromise (OIC) program. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fresh Start Initiative can help stave off IRS collection activities that include:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Bank Levy: The IRS can seize funds from your bank accounts.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Wage Garnishment: A portion of your wages can be deducted and sent directly to the IRS.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Seizure of Assets: The IRS may seize personal property, such as a car or home, to satisfy the tax debt.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Hiring <a href=\"https:\/\/optimataxrelief.com\/blog\/does-the-irs-use-private-collection-agencies-pcas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Private Collection Agencies<\/a>: Assigning the debt to authorized private agencies to pursue payment.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Filing Lawsuits: Taking legal action to recover the owed amount through court proceedings.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Seizing Tax Refunds: Offsetting unpaid taxes with federal or state tax refunds owed to the taxpayer.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Federal Tax Lien: Filing a legal claim against the taxpayer\u2019s property to secure the debt, making it difficult to sell or refinance assets.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All this said, many taxpayers ask, \u201cHow much does the IRS Fresh Start Program cost?\u201d It\u2019s important to understand that the IRS Fresh Start Program itself does not have a specific cost, as it is not a single program but rather a collection of tax relief options offered directly by the IRS. However, there may be fees associated with the specific components of the program, as well as potential costs if you hire a tax professional to assist with the application process. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-eligibility-requirements-for-the-irs-fresh-start-initiative-nbsp\"><strong>Eligibility Requirements for the IRS Fresh Start Initiative<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To qualify, taxpayers must meet specific eligibility requirements depending on the program they apply for, such as installment agreements, Offer in Compromise (OIC), penalty abatement, or lien withdrawal.

These extensions can alleviate penalties, providing additional time to organize finances and file taxes correctly. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Eligibility: <\/strong>Unemployed individuals receiving unemployment benefits may qualify for an extension.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Penalty Relief:<\/strong> The extension helps avoid penalties for late filing, offering more time to submit accurate returns.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Automatic Approval:<\/strong> The six-month extension is typically automatic for those who file Form 4868.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Extended Deadline:<\/strong> Taxpayers can file their returns by October 15, instead of the usual April deadline.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Unemployment Benefits: <\/strong>Unemployment benefits are taxable, and the extension provides more time to address these taxable amounts.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to understand eligibility and ensure that the extension is properly applied to avoid penalties.

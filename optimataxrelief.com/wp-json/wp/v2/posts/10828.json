The amount increases to up to $20,000 if you received a Pell Grant while in school. Forgiveness would be applied to those who submit a simple application to verify their income through the Department of Education. Borrowers on an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan would automatically receive loan relief.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"TextRun SCXW55325710 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW55325710 BCX0\">In December 2022, the Supreme Court <\/span><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW55325710 BCX0\">put the plan on hold as there are multiple lawsuits challenging the lawfulness of the plan.

However, Biden\u2019s American Rescue Plan of 2021 included a measure that exempts forgiven student debt from being taxed through 2025.

Since tax season has already begun and no debt has been cancelled, you may not have to worry about the taxation until 2024. However, this allows you greater time to plan accordingly. When the time comes, your forgiven debt will be added to your taxable income under Cancellation of Debt (COD) income. The exact amount forgiven is usually stated on Form 1099-C, so it is probably safe to assume that student loan forgiveness will work the same.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The taxes owed on the debt will depend on your income tax bracket. Indiana has a flat tax rate of 3.23% for 2022. Indiana residents may also have to pay county taxes. Minnesota&#8217;s income tax rates are graduated for 2022, ranging from 5.35% to 9.85%. Mississippi does not have state income tax on the first $5,000 of taxable income but has a flat rate of 5% for all taxable income over $10,000. North Carolina\u2019s 2022 flat tax rate of 4.99% will result in a state tax liability for the cancelled debt. Finally, Wisconsin has a graduate tax rate ranging from 3.54% to 5.3% in 2022. Borrowers can multiply their income tax&nbsp;rate by the forgiven amount to find their state tax liability. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Tax Help for Student Loan Borrowers<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you live in one of the states that will tax student loan forgiveness, you can begin preparing now. The plan is still being reviewed by the Supreme Court which gives you extra time to put money aside for the extra taxes you will owe. In short, receiving up to $20,000 in student loan forgiveness can result in an unexpected state tax liability. If the debt is forgiven, borrowers are allowed to opt out of receiving loan cancellation through the Department of Education. The only exception is if you are one of the 8 million borrowers who will receive automatic loan forgiveness because you are enrolled in an income-driven repayment program.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">These new changes can result in a more stressful tax season.

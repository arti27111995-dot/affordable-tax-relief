For example, the interest rate accumulating on unpaid taxes was 3% for half of 2020 and all of 2021. In April 2022, we saw it increase by 1% each quarter until it hit 6%. Now, the second quarter of 2024 will mark the third consecutive quarter with a rate of 8% for interest. The question remains: Will the rate continue to increase? Phil thinks so. It\u2019s been said numerous times that now is a terrible time to owe the IRS. Spiking interest rates mean more expensive penalties and interest. Taxpayers should act immediately to get their tax issues resolved. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Back Taxes Affect Your Passports&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you owe a significant amount of back taxes and the IRS has issued a certification to the U.S. State Department, they can deny your passport application or revoke your current passport. But don\u2019t worry. Before the IRS certifies your tax debt to the State Department, they will notify you in writing about the impending certification. You have the opportunity to resolve your tax debt, enter into a payment plan, or request other relief options before the certification occurs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The 1099-K is a Wild Card<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The reporting thresholds for Form 1099-K have changed quite a bit in the past few years. Remember, Form 1099-K is an informational tax form used to report certain types of payment card and third-party network transactions to the IRS. If you collect payments for your business through PayPal, Venmo, or others, you probably know about Form 1099-K. As of now, you would receive a 1099-K in 2025 if you had transactions of $5,000 or more in 2024. However, a much smaller $600 threshold will go into effect for tax year 2025. Remember, you should report this taxable income even if you do not receive IRS Form 1099-K.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you need tax help, contact us today for a <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/app.optimataxrelief.com\/tax-problems\/?t=99&amp;utm_source=otr-blog-post&amp;utm_campaign=blog-cta&amp;adgroup=free-consultation&amp;network=otr-blogl&amp;ad=03-08-2024%22%20%EF%B7%9FHYPERLINK%20%22https:\/\/app.optimataxrelief.com\/tax-problems\/?t=99&amp;utm_source=otr-blog-post&amp;utm_campaign=blog-cta&amp;adgroup=free-consultation&amp;network=otr-blogl&amp;ad=04-19-2024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Free Consultation<\/strong><\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today, Optima Tax Relief Lead Tax Attorney, Phil, talks about his three takeaways from the current tax landscape.&nbsp;&nbsp; IRS Interest Rates Could Increase&nbsp; For much of the pandemic, we saw IRS interest rates hold steady.

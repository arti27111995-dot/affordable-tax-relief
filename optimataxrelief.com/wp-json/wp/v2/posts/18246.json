One of the most critical aspects of your tax responsibility is self-employment tax, which covers Social Security and Medicare contributions. In this guide, we&#8217;ll break down what self-employment tax is, how it&#8217;s calculated, and provide examples to help you navigate this key aspect of tax compliance.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is Self-Employment Tax?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Self-employment tax is a contribution to Social Security and Medicare for individuals who work for themselves. Traditionally, these contributions are split between the employer and the employee. For employees, 6.2% of their wages go toward Social Security and 1.45% goes toward Medicare. Their employer matches these amounts. However, if you&#8217;re <a href=\"https:\/\/affordabletaxrelief.com\/blog\/tax-forms-for-self-employed-individuals\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">self-employed<\/a>, you must pay both the employer&#8217;s and the employee&#8217;s share, which totals 15.3% of your net earnings:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>12.4% for Social Security\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>2.9% for Medicare\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This tax ensures that even though you don&#8217;t have an employer contributing on your behalf, you&#8217;re still putting into the Social Security and Medicare systems.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Self-Employment Tax and Income Tax<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to note that self-employment tax is separate from income tax. You will still need to file an income tax return and pay taxes based on your total income, just like any other taxpayer. However, self-employed individuals can deduct 50% of their self-employment tax when calculating their adjusted gross income (AGI). This deduction helps reduce your taxable income and partially offsets the burden of paying both the employee and employer portions of the tax.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Breaking Down the Components<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Social Security:<\/strong> In 2024, the Social Security portion of the self-employment tax is 12.4%, with the first $168,600 of net income subject to this tax. Earnings beyond this threshold are not subject to the Social Security portion of the self-employment tax. In 2025, the threshold is capped at $176,100. \u00a0\u00a0<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Medicare: <\/strong>The Medicare portion is 2.9% of net earnings. Unlike Social Security, there is no income cap for Medicare tax. In other words, all net earnings are subject to the 2.9% tax.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Additional Medicare Tax:<\/strong> For higher-income individuals, an additional 0.9% Medicare tax may apply to earnings exceeding $200,000 for single filers, heads of household, or qualifying surviving spouses with dependent children. For married couples filing jointly, this amount increases to $250,000. If you are married filing separately, you\u2019ll pay the additional Medicare tax on earnings that exceed $125,000.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Who Pays Self-Employment Tax?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you earn $400 or more in net earnings from self-employment during the year, you&#8217;re required to pay self-employment tax. This applies to sole proprietors, independent contractors, freelancers, and even those running side gigs in addition to their regular job. Essentially, if you&#8217;re generating income without an employer withholding Social Security and Medicare taxes, you&#8217;re responsible for self-employment tax. In addition, if you earned at least $108.28 from church employment, you need to pay self-employment taxes. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Calculating Self-Employment Tax<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To calculate self-employment tax, you&#8217;ll first need to determine your net earnings with Schedule SE, Self-Employment Tax. This is your total income from self-employment minus allowable business expenses. Once you&#8217;ve calculated your net earnings, you&#8217;ll apply the 15.3% self-employment tax rate to 92.35% of that amount. Why 92.35%? The IRS allows a deduction for the employer portion of your self-employment tax, which is the equivalent of 7.65% of your earnings. For high-income earners, there is an Additional Medicare Tax of 0.9% on wages, compensation, and self-employment income above a certain threshold. For self-employed individuals, this threshold is:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>$200,000 if filing as a single taxpayer\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>$250,000 if married filing jointly\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Example:<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re a freelance graphic designer and your business earned $60,000 for the year.

Common deductions include home office expenses, business-related travel, and health insurance premiums.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Failing to make these payments can result in penalties at the end of the year, so it&#8217;s crucial to stay on top of your tax obligations throughout the year. Given the complexity of self-employment tax rules, it&#8217;s advisable to consult a tax professional. They can help you navigate the intricacies of tax laws, identify eligible deductions, and ensure compliance.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Benefits of Paying Self-Employment Tax<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While paying self-employment tax can feel like a heavy burden, it\u2019s important to recognize the benefits. These payments contribute to your Social Security and Medicare accounts, which provide financial assistance in retirement and help cover healthcare costs once you\u2019re eligible. By consistently paying into these systems, you&#8217;re building up your benefits for the future.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tax Help for Self-Employed Individuals\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Self-employment tax is an essential consideration for individuals working independently.
